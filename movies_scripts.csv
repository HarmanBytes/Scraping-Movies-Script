0,"A Â¥1,000,000,000,000,000 Ransom (2015) - full transcript",,"In this country,
budget deficits and pension problems
and the intergenerational inequity formed by
a declining birthrate and aging population
have become a major concern.
However, the government
has taken no clear actions to absolve these issues.
As a result, one man has directed his anger at the nation.
[Mayu Cellphone]
Hello?
What is it, Mayu?
This is Ms. Shinoda Yumi, correct?
Huh?
I'm terribly sorry
but I have kidnapped your daughter, Miss Mayu.
What... what are you saying?
Don't panic.
If you adhere to my demands,
I will ensure the safety of your daughter.
Details will be sent to the media
and I will not be contacting you from this phone again.
Our name is
The Leaders of the Revolution.
[Public Department]
Boss!
There's a declaration of crime at the inquiry window!
Every Morning Newspaper Company
Boss!
There's a declaration of crime at the inquiry window!
Every Morning Newspaper Company
What?
""To the news agencies:""
""Everyone in mass communication,
please pass this along to the police.""
""Our name is The Leaders of the Revolution.""
""On this day I have kidnapped and am safeguarding
Motoazabu Elementary School fifth grader Shinoda Mayu.""
Metropolitan Police Department
The crime declaration has reached
every mass media company.
Metropolitan Police Department
The crime declaration has reached
every mass media company.
The possible victim of kidnapping
is Minato District Motoazabu Elementary School
fifth grader Shinoda Mayu.
That girl is Former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake's
granddaughter.
What?
- Kataoka, for now, you take command of the site.
- Yes, sir.
First, visit the home of the victim.
- They don't seem to be answering the phone.
- Understood.
Everyone else,
enforce press restraints on the media.
And also, contact the father's workplace.
Yes, sir.
Chief,
and the kidnapper's demand?
A ransom of 1,085 trillion yen!
""Mayu is in fact former Deputy Prime Minister
and active member of the House of Representatives""
""Kunitake Yoshikazu's granddaughter.""
""As he was questioned for violating
Political Funds Control Law""
""the case was dropped under suspicious circumstances.""
""It was that Kunitake Yoshikazu.""
""We will guarantee the hostage's safety.""
""We are keeping her somewhere she cannot escape,
but otherwise respecting her freedom""
""and of course providing meals""
""Respecting her freedom""?
Do they mean they won't tie her up or harm her?
So it seems.
""In the case that our demands are not met""
""we cannot guarantee her survival.""
""As for our demands""
""a ransom of 1085 trillion yen""
""Within a week from now,
Wednesday, September 16, by 9 in the morning""
""have it prepared below the monument
at Kaze no Mori Park.""
""1085 trillion yen.
Approximately one quadrillion yen.""
""I assume you understand the significance of that.""
THE ONE QUADRILLION YEN RANSOM
Mr. Kataoka
Are you with the police?
I'm Mayu's father, Shinoda Yuichi.
- Special Investigations. I'm Kataoka.
- And I'm Imamura.
I've been contacting my home and my wife's cell
but I couldn't get through.
To be safe, we will be going in first.
Okay.
Mr. Kataoka!
Yumi!
Should I call an ambulence?
No, there is no need.
I am a doctor.
It's anemia.
It's her constitution.
Yumi? Yumi.
Are you okay?
Yes.
So then, regarding the phone call.
Did it have anything to do with your daughter?
Yes.
Kidnapped... they said they took Mayu.
I got a call from Mayu's cellphone.
I picked it up thinking it was Mayu and was told that.
Was it a man's voice?
A woman's voice?
It was a man.
Perhaps in his 30s.
Did he give his name?
Uh, something about the Revolution or...
Must be the Leaders of the Revolution.
And? What else did he say?
He said he will not call here again.
You said he's not calling here again, right?
Yes, but just in case,we have to be ready.
So she was targeted because
she's Kunitake's grandchild!
I'm sorry.
It seems Mayu was absent from cram school today.
Did you hear anything about this?
No.
Well, then, does she have any
friends she usually plays with after school?
Friends...
Is she always in the house,
not even trying to make friends?
That's why I can't trust you with anything!
But she never talks to me about anything.
Father.
Yumi, what were you doing?
And you call yourself a politician's daughter!
I'm sorry.
You aren't the one's facing the full brunt of this.
I am!
I'm truly sorry.
- Um, right now, more than blaming...
- Who are you?
- Metropolitan Police Special Investigatio-
- Who is in charge here?
That would be me.
- Have we met...?
- Yes.
I had been assigned as your escort.
It has been a while.
Huh, so a non-career detective is in charge, then.
Excuse me, that was rude.
In any case, have the Metropolitan Police,
National Police Agency, and Public Safety
work together and investigate this case
until it is resolved.
Yes, sir.
More this way.
There.
Look here.
Have you given any thought to the ransom's meaning?
1085 trillion yen...
Just about one quadrillion yen.
They aren't being very realistic.
It's Japan's total budget deficit
at the end of the last fiscal year.
What?
Even the criminal has to know that there's no way
we can prepare one quadrillion yen.
In that case...
It wouldn't be strange if he is thinking politically.
Plus, he's calling himself ""Leader of the Revolution""
Public Safety is gonna be all over this case.
No doubt.
Our priority is the hostage's safety.
As you are aware,
aside from his eldest daughter Yumi,
Former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake
has a son, Mr. Kazuyuki, who followed in his footsteps
and became a member of the Diet.
He has two young children as well.
Which means the criminal
deliberately targeted Ms. Yumi's daughter.
The politican has strict security at his side
that would have prevented it.
What is the home situation of the Shinoda family?
Mr. Kataoka
Former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake's
eldest daughter Yumi
married a doctor, Mr. Shinoda Yuichi
12 years ago.
The kidnapped Mayu is their only child.
Three times a week,
Mayu goes to the cram school by Azabudai Station.
That day, cram school was in session, but she was truent.
We estimate that the kidnapper acted
while she was going from
elementary school to cram school.
Any witnesses?
From the initial stage of inquiry,
there are no witnesses.
We reviewed the surveillance footage from around
the station, but we found no evidence.
But how is it that a 10-year-old child
was kidnapped without anyone seeing it happen?
What's wrong?
Why did the culprit bother to call the mother?
I wonder...
Since he announced his demands through the media...
Excuse me!
The media networks have received a second message!
Here is the attached image.
She is holding today's evening newspaper.
It's the second message from the criminal.
I will now read it.
""We the Leaders of the Revolution have prepared
two options for the Japanese government.""
""Option One""
""To pay the previously requested 1085 trillion yen.""
""This amount is our country's fiscal deficit
from the end of last year.""
""The dawn that we receive it""
""we intend to use it to help reduce the deficit.""
- That's so much!
- There's no way we can arrange that!
So it's a political crime after all.
""Option 2""
""Take responsibility for the financial crisis,
and for the sake of the nation,""
""present a formal apology
and a concrete economic recovery plan.""
""By 9AM tomorrow, please announce
which option you will take on television.""
""We hope for a response from the Prime Minister
or former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake.""
That's it.
They want us to respond within 12 hours.
Chief, do you want to make this an open investigation?
All we can do is wait for the Official Residence
to make a move.
[Former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake]
Why so focused on Kunitake?
[Former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake]
Why so focused on Kunitake?
The Next Morning
6 DAYS until the Deadline
The Next Morning
Eat.
Is this not good enough for a little lady raised in luxury?
If you don't eat, you'll die.
If you die, it'd be a real problem for me.
So eat.
- These fur seals, are they eloping?
- I wonder!
But they seem to get along well.
- This is going to cause a commotion again.
- It's an idyllic sort of news, isn't it.
Yes, it's healing.
Uh, we have just received word
that the Metropolitan Police Department
will be holding an emergency press conference.
Yesterday morning
a student attending the metropolitan area
Motoazabu Private Elementary,
Shinoda Mayu,
was kidnapped while returning from school.
But the criminal appeared to be targeting
the Prime Minister or Kunitake.
It means they've left the decision for someone else.
Do you mean you've been contacted by the criminal?
Yes. To prevent intereference with the investigation
we unfortunately cannot provide details
But from the criminal's statement we can assume
the criminal is a man in his 30s
who is strongly discontented with society.
He has great Internet expertise
and there is a possibility of multiple offenders.
Can we please have some more information?
We cannot provide any more detail.
Are you saying you cannot present
the kidnapper's statement?
Wasn't there a demand for a ransom?
I cannot answer that question.
I am addressing the criminal.
If I do this now, we can still make it.
Please release the hostage as soon as possible.
We and the government,
we are lending our ears to your voices
and are preparing for this discussion.
That is all.
- Why won't you release the criminal's statement?
- What is the ransom?
- Answer us!
- Tell us why!
So, shall we start it from this end?
Woah, that's crazy! What is that?
A quadrillion yen?
The criminal's statement got leaked to the Internet?
Leaked?
It was posted to a bulletin board site
and it's being spread via social networks.
Did the media leak it?
No, the risk would be too great.
The culprit likely released it after seeing the interview.
So he's determined to be showy with this.
We just received one more message.
I'll display it on the monitor.
""Please make this the last time
you put off a client of the government.""
""If you do not take action
and abide by the September 16th deadline""
""we cannot guarantee the survival of the hostage.""
Can you trace the sender of this message?
They used multiple foreign servers to send it.
Meaning, our culprit has Internet expertise on his side.
Understood.
It sounds like we've received instruction
from the Prime Minister.
Our country does not surrender to any kind of terrorism.
For the dignity of the nation, let us rescue Miss Mayu
and arrest the criminal before the deadline.
Extra! Extra!
News on the ransom case!
News on the kidnapping case!
Here! Extra!
Here. Here, extra!
Kidnapping is wrong,
but honesty, I'd like to hear
what the government has to say.
No matter how you look at it,
the money isn't the point, is it?
I mean, one quadrillion yen is definitely impossible!
If they just deal with the reconstruction
that hostage kid will be released, won't she?
So why won't they do it?
'S suspicious isn't it?
Now that you've heard the voices from the streets,
Mr. Yamashita, what do you think of the criminal's threat?
During his time in the Ministry
Mr. Kunitake funded public works recklessly
and was a typical profit-driven politician
the price of which was, undoubtedly,
our current financial problems.
To put it shortly, the criminal's point is not incorrect.
What do you think of the criminal's objective
not being the ransom
but former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake?
I have entrusted the police with the investigation.
I will not be making any irresponsible statements.
Good bye.
[Was the statement calling out Kunitake posted by the criminal?]
Finally, it's begun.

An album?
Sorry for asking at this difficult time.
But anything that could provide a clue will help.
Just a moment.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They haven't been organized.
Oh, no, thank you very much.
We will use these for reference.
Um, I may have more in the bedroom.
I'll go take a look.
Ah, excuse me.
Ms. Yumi!
Ms. Yumi! Ms. Yumi!
Pardon me.
This is concerning.
I'll take her to my university's hospital.
I will start the car.
Imamura!
There's a crowd of reporters out front!
Do you have a mask?
Oh, are you okay?
Someone's coming out!
Has something happened?
Are there any developments on the case?
Is she alright?
Is everything alright?
Have you received any new demands from the kidnapper?
What is former Deputy Prime Minister Kunitake doing?
Please move aside!
Move aside! It's dangerous!
Where will you be going?
It's dangerous, so please move aside!
You too, please move aside!
[Beyond-Pretty Detective (Plainclothes)]
Where will you be going?
- It's dangerous, so please move aside!
- Is Mrs. Shinoda okay?
You too, please move aside!
It's dangerous, so mo-
5 DAYS until the deadline
[Aren't SIT not supposed to reveal their faces?]
Looks like we have a rather incompetent
detective on our hands.
That was an outrageous thing to do!
Why did you go outside without putting on a mask?
I... was in a hurry...
You know Special Investigations
can't show their faces to the media!
The consequence is an immediate transfer!
It was my lack of leadership.
They're saying Public Safety is using this
to take over the investigation.
The Kataoka team will have to back down.
Just wait a moment! This was my mistake!
The team has nothing to do wi-
This mistake doesn't put only your neck on the line!
The Kataoka Team is banned
from Investigation Headquarters.
Just continue checking in on the hospital and victim's home.
That is all.
- Please wait a minute!
- We're going.
- But...
- We are going!
Hey.
There's a phone call for Miss Beyond Pretty Detective.
Please! Don't say that!
They say they have information.
They said, ""I don't want to talk unless it's with her!""
Yes?
What?
Thank you.
- Do you have something to say?
- You sure are pretty.
Well, ""Beyond Pretty"" might be saying too much.
So about this blog.
Do you go to matchmaking parties?
Detectives don't have as much free time as you think.
On top of being strong-willed,
she's a black belt in judo and karate.
Even as her boss, there are times I can't stop her.
The title of the blog in question?
""Petition Blog""
""Petition"" as in, an appeal?
That's right.
But it was deleted recently.
- Deleted?
- Ah!
I took a screenshot of it. Would you like to see?
Yes, please. Show us.
S... screen... screenshot?
I saved an image of the webpage.
Great job.
It was a pretty popular blog.
I saw the threat on the news
and thought it sounded similar.
When I went to confirm it, the page was already gone.
In what ways was it similar?
Well, the part about intergenerational equity,
and the opposition to Kunitake.
It's certainly similar.
Do you know anything about the writer of this blog?
It says his name is ""Naoto""
but he never told me his real name.
Huh? Wait a minute.
You've actually met him?
Yeah. He seemed like a pretty nice guy.
Maybe around his mid-30s?
He ignored me for a long time
but after saying that I wanted to meet him so many times
we started talking about meeting offline.
Tell us in detail. What did you talk about?
Well, we didn't think it was worthwhile
with just the two of us
so we also met with a girl who was leaving
the same kind of comments.
Seriously, I think you're totally right, Naoto.
Half a Year Earlier
Seriously, I think you're totally right, Naoto.
Half a Year Earlier
The guy who designed Japan's pension plan
is criminal isn't he?
Half a Year Earlier
The guy who designed Japan's pension plan
is criminal isn't he?
I bet he was well aware it would collapse in the future!
As long as their own generation is fine, right?!
You've had too much to drink, Teppei.
If there are such incredible students as Teppei
I guess this country isn't at a complete loss.
Hey! Can't you take me seriously?
I want you and me to have a productive debate!
Don't get in a fight.
What is your problem?
But something felt off...
What was it?
That girl was completely uncommitted
and even our all-important Naoto just quietly nodded
and he didn't join the debate at all and...
Well it seemed only I was doing any talking.
Is there else anything about this ""Naoto""
that left an impression on you?
Ah, come to think of it, there was this one time
that guy started to heat up.
Naoto, where are you from?
Hey, can you cut it out with the matchmaking questions?
It's fine isn't it?
Since we're finally able to meet.
Do you know of Tokachi, Hokkaido?
I do!
When you say Tokachi,
you're talking about the civil engineering capital, right?
Because a big name politician took the budget by force
the public works budget skyrocketed.
That again?
My...
My friend's father was relying on
the public works projects...
Oh, was he in construction?
So he was affected by the structural reforms?
When the budget was cut,
the whole industry toppled at once.
My friend's place couldn't deal with it either
so one day at sunset, his father
tied a noose around his neck and hung himself.
Even now I think
is there anything I could have done?
I don't think he was lying.
Naoto is from Tokachi, Hokkaido.
This is a pretty good clue, isn't it?
We don't know that he's the criminal yet.
We just know the blog had similar statements.
Well, yes...
Thank you very much.
We may need to speak to you another time
and if so, we will be counting on you.
Send her the image of blog.
Oh, um...
I heard you can receive payment for
cooperating in an investigation...
Thank you!
What do you think?
The blog had a reference to Kunitake too
but more than anything,
the blog was just recently deleted.
It's hard to say that's a coincidence.
In that case,
why did Naoto agree to an offline meeting?
Maybe at that time, he hadn't planned the crime yet.
Either that or...
What?
Maybe he was lonely.
[Confidential video]
You really are useless aren't you.
Not only did you refuse to marry
the Diet member I offered you to marry some doctor
but you could only give birth to a girl.
But Mayu does well in school and...
Even so, what can a girl amount to?
Are you going to continue to be a politician?
Of course I am!
You think I can quit such a rich business?
Do you see anything suspicious about this blog?
Hey, don't come here anymore.
This conversation stays here.
We just found someone who may be our suspect.
A suspect?
A teacher called Hayasaka at Mayu's elementary school
He has a history of causing problems
through political activity and has leftist views.
During class, he began a special lesson on the economic collapse.
- A special lesson?
- Yes.
Right now someone on-site is thoroughly investigating it
so we may come to a conclusion soon.
So, what about this guy?
The chief hates using evidence from the Internet.
You can look into it if you want.
Just, if you do
make sure you get substantial evidence.
- Understood.
- Hey.
What's this outsider doing here?
Can you think of anything else?
Any features or?
Honestly, I don't remember anything beyond this.
I have work to do. Is it okay if I go back?
Yes, sorry.
How is it, Odagiri? Any developments?
Of course there aren't.
You know that, don't you?
Hey, lighten up.
Anyway, you said you were from Hokkaido, didn't you?
Yes, that's right.
The bright men raised in Tokachi,
what high school do they go to?
That would be Obihiro's Kashiwa and Nishi High Schools.
Contact the Hokkaido Prefectural Police
and ask them for those schools' graduation albums.
A change of clothes.
It can't be comfortable to stay in uniform.
Get changed 'cause this is gonna go on for a while.
I made it mild.
How many times do I have to say it?
It's gonna be a long battle.
I can at least make you dinner.
Thank you.
I'll show you something interesting.
Not only did you refuse to marry the Diet member
I offered you to marry some doctor
but you could only give birth to a girl.
But Mayu does well in school and...
Even so, what can a girl amount to?
Are you going to continue to be a politician?
Of course I am!
You think I can quit such a rich business?
This video was leaked onto the Internet
and whether it was the kidnapper or not is unclear
but Mr. Kunitake's controversial remarks
have garnered a big response-
Once you finish that, do some studying.
4 Days until the Deadline
Kunitake's wrecked, huh?
He's just a self-centered, self-serving politician, isn't he!
More importantly, this.
Sorry for calling you in again.
You will be paid for cooperation this time as well.
Am I supposed to find someone
who looks like Naoto in this?
I think this is him.
Without a doubt?
He's aged, but otherwise
his appearance hasn't changed at all.
No, I'm sure of it.
Should we tell headquarters?
Slow down.
We've only pinpointed who ran the blog.
Headquarters won't act on just that.
- Then...
- We just have to do it ourselves.
Kashiwa High School class of 1998's third year E-group.
The name is Ito Naoya.
Get the Hokkaido Prefectural Police to look up
his past and current addresses.
Is he the kidnapper?
We can't say anything for sure at this stage.
He's currently in his mid-30s, but does he look familiar?
I don't know.
It seems he is calling himself ""Naoto.""
Does that sound familiar?
You don't know anything do you?
Is there anything else you can recall?
It doesn't matter how trivial it seems.
Well, um...
What is it? Say it!
If you're looking for a woman who was
speaking to Mayu, I saw her.
A woman... what were they like?
She was a nurse at this hospital.
But she's quit already.
Where did you see her?
Near the station.
They were talking closely.
When it happened, did you say anything?
If it's someone you know,
you'd usually say something, right?
This nurse sounds suspicious.
I don't want to disclose too much about
our former employees' private lives.
Even if it's not directly related to solving this case
please let us know.
Fine.
This person is the one who left.
Why did she leave?
It's only a rumor
but it's said that she was having an affair with Dr. Shinoda.
As I thought.
And, what is her name?
She's called Hashimoto Saori.
Are you Hashimoto Saori?
Did you say September 9th?
Yes. That afternoon.
You're looking for an alibi, right?
- This is a formal questio-
- Excuse me, but
We've received information that
you were having an affair with Dr. Shinoda.
I wouldn't threaten the government
over something like that.
I was just working as usual on that day.
You can confirm this easily.
I see.
Actually,
I've received enough consolation money to be satisfied.
I knew he had a wife.
Plus, I bought a Benz.
I bear no grudges against him.
- Can I go now?
- Yes, thank you for your time.
Can I ask one last thing?
Yes.
Have you met Mayu anywhere outside of the hospital?
No, I have not.
I see. Thank you very much.
[Hashimoto Saori]
[Are you the kidnapper?]

are you not concerned about your granddaughter's safety?""
""Mrs. Shinoda Yumi""
""Miss Mayu's mother""
""What are you doing right now?""
""The government and the police, the country""

""The government and the police, the country""

3 Days until the Deadline
""will they protect what you hold dear?""
It's worded so strangely.
Why is he suddenly bringing the mother into it?
Excuse me! Mr. Kunitake!
What are your thoughts on the latest statement?
Do you believe it was the kidnapper
who exposed your verbal abuse?
Are you planning on just standing by
when your grandchild is killed?
Who said that just now?!
To put it in my own words,
have you ever thought you might be the cause of this?!
You bastard... this is slander!
Wait a moment!
With regards to Ito Naoya's upbringing
his father was ran a construction company in Tokachi.
As a result of the government's
haphazard public works spending
the once-successful company quickly went downhill.
When Ito Naoya was a high schooler
his father hung himself.
My friend's place couldn't deal with it either
so one day at sunset, his father
tied a noose around his neck and hung himself.
So he had been talking about himself.
Sorry, continue.
His misfortune doesn't end there.
He had an older brother he had become
estranged to since their father's death.
The brother, then, had started up a small factory
started a family, and had been living in Hokkaido.
When last year, their bankruptcy drove
the household of four to suicide.
His first reunion with his brother
was when he met his body.
During the wake, Ito Naoya
found out that his brother's young children,
his own niece and nephew
had become victims as well, and cried.
On top of the difficult management,
there was this year's tax increase, right?
8% was a big blow to the smaller companies.
But in the end, it's the same as his father, right?
See, because Kunitake's handout policy ended...
But this time Naoya will truly be all alone, won't he.
He holds a grudge against the government,
especially Kunitake.
Chief, he appears to have a substantial motive.
Yes.
We found a Tokyo street address for Ito Naoya
but in April, he moved out without notifying anyone.
Thank you for waiting. Here you are.
Thank you very much.
- Here, thank you for waiting.
- Thanks.
You can't win a battle on an empty stomach.
Mmmm!
The ginger pork is so good!
Isn't it? The tonkatsu is great too.
You should try it next time.
Oh, just give me one piece.
- What are you talking about?!
- Well why not?
- The heck are you saying?
- But you have so much!
Yeah, I have a lot, but you have a lot of your own!
- Can't you just try it next time!
- Oh, come on!
Do you think Ito Naoya
had anyone he could eat meals together with like this?
Talking and eating like this...
I wonder if he has a relationship like that.
Here, dinner's ready.
Thank you.
With no family...
There's no doubt that this crime started
with a political grudge.
But aside from that
there are hidden motives like family and loneliness.
Perhaps Mayu was lonely as well?
Maybe even kidnapping me won't change anything.
2 Days until the Deadline
You are Dr. Hayasaka Norio, correct?
Can you give me a break?
Since I've verified my alibi.
It's a great shame, but we in the police
are working to rescue Mayu as quickly as possible.
We only have two days left until the criminal's deadline.
As her homeroom teacher, we ask that you cooperate.
Go ahead.
What was Mayu like in school?
At first there was no problem at all.
- She was well-behaved and-
- At first?
We heard you had a special lesson on bankruptcy.
Yes.
Alright everyone, today's lesson is going to be a little tough
Teacher, what's bankruptcy?
Good question. Bankruptcy is...
I started talking about the country's budget deficit.
What would happen if the economy continues to fail.
And I did a simulation with the students.
I thought I'd make Japan's current state
into a teaching game.
But I should have been more mindful
around Shinoda Mayu.
- Teacher?
- Yes?
My dad said that the ones who spent up the budget
was Shinoda's grandpa's era, right?
Oh, wasn't it Kunitake?
I've heard that before.
Me too!
Hey! Now, now,
Shinoda has nothing to do with this!
I thought that the taunting wouldn't go
beyond the lesson, when...
Hey, give me Kunitake's backpack!
- Give it! Give it!
- Cut it out!
Hey, stop it!
Stop it!
Stop! Stop it!
Please! Stop! Give it back!
Wait!
Stop it! Stop!
This kind of bullying began to evolve.
With regards to Shinoda Mayu
I truly cannot apologize enough.
Detectives
please do everything you can to save her.
Maybe even kidnapping me won't change anything.
[KUNITAKE DEBT]
You, write a letter.
A letter.
I'm sorry.
No, pardon me.
Oh, sorry.
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.
I have kidnapped your daughter, Miss Mayu
She's the Former Deputy Prime Minister's granddaughter.
- And the kidnapper's demand?
- A ransom of 1,085 trillion yen!
- You've actually met him?
- Yeah.
He seemed like a pretty nice guy.
I think this is him.
Have you met with Mayu before?
No, I have not.
Maybe even kidnapping me won't change anything.
He appears to hold a grudge against the government,
especially Kunitake.
He has a substantial motive.
Yes.
You, write a letter.
I'm coming in.
[From Mayu]
Huh? Is this...?
Ms. Yumi! Look.
""Mom,
I am doing well.""
""I am eating well.""
""So please do not worry.""
""Mayu""
I'm sorry.
What's wrong?
Are you alright?
Shall I call an ambulance?
No, I have medicine.
Wait right here!
Take it with this.
- Sorry. I'll pay...
- Oh no, it's fine
If it weighs on you then
just put 100 yen in a donation box for me.
But are you really alright?
Yes. Thank you very much.
Then take care!
We'll keep this for the time being.
I will visit again.
I'll be going now.
[From Mayu]
""To the mom I hate""
""Don't look for me.""
""Even if you look, you won't find me.""
""Because I am invisible.""
""Hasn't it always been that way?""
""Good bye.""
1 Day until the Deadline
The deadline given by the kidnapper
is coming up tomorrow.
1 Day until the Deadline
The deadline given by the kidnapper
is coming up tomorrow.
But as of now, the government
has not released any statements.
Mr. Kamijo
this time, instead of using e-mail, the criminal
delivered a letter directly.
Why do you think they are running such a risk?
Having seen the government's inaction
they may have become frustrated.
Perhaps they calculated that by appealing
to the direct family
they'd send a more effective message?
Since, for the mother
this is a matter worth more than money.
As for the content of the letter
it says that Mayu is safe and not to worry.
This may be intended to create pressure for the ransom...
Mom?
Not now.
I have a headache.
[Kunitake virus]
[Handout kid]
Because I am invisible.
Hasn't it always been that way?
Good bye. Good bye.
So.
You say Hashimoto Saori and Mr. Shinoda
didn't have a smooth break up?
By no means.
He killed infant inside her.
Huh? Killed?
The child Saori was pregnant with.
That man called Shinoda forced her to abort it.
She couldn't get over it for the longest time!
She's definitely lying about not holding a grudge.
You think Hashimoto Saori has a motive?
We're suspecting Ito Naoya right now, correct?
The chances that Hashimoto Saori
]is the culprit are slim...
Have you ever gone mountain climbing before?
What?
There's more than one way
to climb a mountain, you know.
If you apply different rules,
you might unexpectedly find a breakthrough.
Different rules...
It looks delicious!
Actually, I just had this veggie soba the other day.
You've eaten it?
You really like your ramen, don't you, Mr. Yamashita?

How did it taste?
Oh! It was delicious.
Why isn't anyone doing anything!
A transmission?
The kidnapping case. Got it.
There has been a development in the kidnapping case.
We are now switching to the
front of Shinoda Mayu's home.
Oh! They're coming! They're coming!
Mayu's mother has just returned!
It's Mayu's mother!
- Mayu's mother, what are your thoughts!
- Please say a few words!
How is your condition?
How do you feel?
Is your condition okay?
On the case, on the situation,
has there been any progress?
Please say a few words!
Please share your thoughts!
Look this way.
Over here, your thoughts please!
To the Leaders of the Revolution
I agree with your claims wholeheartedly.
Stop!
What are you doing?
Go inside!
I believe the reason Japan fell into this financial crisis
was the politicians, including my father,
Kunitake Yoshikazu.
As the daughter of Kunitake Yoshikazu
I give my sincerest apologies
to the people of this nation.
So please.
The Leaders of the Revolution
please return my daughter, Mayu, to me!
Stop being ridiculous!
What's wrong with me
fighting for my own daughter?!
I'm begging you.
I can't be away from Mayu like this anymore.
I need to hold Mayu in my arms
and look into her eyes
and have a proper talk with her.
I'm sorry, Mayu.
Please... come back safely.
Let me be your mother once again!
To the kidnappers, I beg of you!
Please return my precious Mayu.
Prime Minister!
Please save my daughter!
Please!
Mayu, I want to see you again.
Let me hold you again.
Mayu... Mayu...
That's enough.
Mom...
So the mother has made a move.
This may have been our culprit's goal.
His goal?
Starting with that first phone call
the kidnapper consistently sent messages to the mother.
If this is the result of that
he may start to act differently.
Sit.
I'm modifying the plan.
Modifying?
I'm modifying the plan.
Modifying?
I'm changing what will happen
in our kidnapping incident.
What are you changing?
I've decided we aren't going
to flee the country together.
What?
- Why?
- Only I'm leaving.
You go home.
Why are you saying that?
You promised that we'd leave together.
You said you'd listen to me.
Three Months Earlier
Kidnap me.
Kidnap me.
And then take me somewhere far away.
What are you talking about all of a sudden?
Overseas would be good.
Somewhere far away.
Somewhere where no one knows
about me, about my family.
Okay.
You're right, I did promise you.
But our general predicament has changed.
Don't try to confuse me with big words.
Your mom has changed, hasn't she?
But Grandpa or Dad will get mad at her
and everything could go right back
to how it was before.
She'll stop caring about me again.
Did you not just see your mom on TV?!
Your mom isn't running from you anymore.
You aren't invisible to her anymore.
Go back to your mom.
That's what you really want, isn't it?
But...
But I want to be with you!
Because you're my family, Naoto!
- Thanks, Mayu.
- See? We need to be together...
If you're with me, you'll end up alone again.
What?
The cancer has spread throughout your body.
It's unfortunate, but we can no longer cure it.
You have maybe one year.
A year?
This disease is going to kill me soon.
That's why I can't stay with you.
No!
No!
I don't want you to die!
Everyone has to die eventually.
It's just that I'm going a little early.
But...
It's thanks to that disease that I met you.
That I figured out what I wanted to do.
I was able to open that door.
I quit my job and started that blog.
I wanted to leave something behind
so I said what had been troubling me
deep within my heart.
I thought if I did that, someone might feel the same.
Maybe things would start changing,
even if it's just a little.
[Saori]
""I was put in a terrible position
by Kunitake Yoshikazu's son-in-law.""
""His daughter, Kunitake's granddaughter,
is an acquaintance of mine.""
That's how I met Saori
and came to know you.
- Want to try this too?
- Yes!
At first, I was wondering whether
I should kidnap you.
I wasn't kind or gentle, but you somehow liked me
and soon we were frequently
meeting each other in secret.
Hey, Mayu.
Are you being bullied?
No. It's nothing.
It doesn't look like nothing.
[KUNITAKE MAYU]
It doesn't look like nothing.
It doesn't look like nothing.
- Does your teacher or mom know about this?
- It's pointless!
No one is looking out for me.
That's when, in my mind,
you and my deceased brother's children connected.
Thanks to Kunitake, thanks to adults, children suffer.
I was fed up with that kind of world.
Kidnap me.
Kidnap me.
And then take me somewhere far away.
The truth is...
I was reading your Petition Blog.
I thought that you'd understand how I felt
so I tried to become your friend.
I thought so.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't doing it for you.
I was doing it for myself.
I thought, ""The world can't stay like this.""
""I can't die leaving it like this.""
Are you really going to die?
Don't frown like that.
You knew from the beginning
you were going to run away by yourself?
I thought that if you were going to stay all alone
I'd take you with me.
But you aren't alone anymore.
You have a mom who will look after you.
I...
I want to go abroad on my own
surround myself in beautiful scenery
and quietly live out my days.
Because that place would probably be
the closest to Heaven.
Let me go.
Alright?
Send me a letter.
Okay.
Last winter, Ito Naoya
suddenly quit working here, correct?
Did he give a reason?
He was an extremely serious person.
Why would such a serious person quit his job?
The reason Ito Naoya retired...
was for health purposes.
At the hospital
he was diagnosed as having only a short time to live.
Alright?
Tomorrow morning, you're going to attend school.
Say, ""I didn't see the kidnapper's face,""
and during the confusion, I'll get away.
You can do that, can't you?
I can do it.
I'll say, ""I was blindfolded the whole time,
so I don't know his face.""
Make sure they let you take that test.
I will.
Promise?
I promise.
- Illness?
- I even got the doctor to confirm.
It's certain.
What did you find?
Regarding the participant in
the offline meeting, Nakagawa Haruka...
I heard it was gainless.
I thought there might be something
so I tried her again.
And then...
Come to think of it, on the way back
he recieved a phone call from a woman.
Did you say a woman?
He seemed very familiar with her
I think he was calling her ""Saori"".
Is that Hashimoto Saori?
I believe that's possible.
A man against the government, Ito Naoya,
knowing his own death was imminent,
and fighting his loneliness, began a blog.
Through this, Hashimoto Saori introduced him to Mayu,
and the kidnapping was planned and executed.
Hmm, it's frustrating.
It's still just conjectures.
Should we further question Hashimoto Saori?
We need to investigate her thoroughly.
That, and do a full investigation of Ito Naoya.
- We're going to headquarters.
- Yes sir.
""To the news media:""
""Finally, it's tomorrow.""
""The arranged time.""
""Please decide whether you will hand over the ransom""
""or Kunitake will apologize.""
Tomorrow morning at 9
as our sovereign nation's dignity rests on
saving my granddaughter from her kidnapper
we have decided to confront the perpetrator.
If there's anything to my being,
I will put my life on the line to rescue
my granddaughter Mayu. That is all.
Please save Mayu!
Grandpa.
The Day of the Deadline
Here is where the former Deputy Prime Minister
and the criminal will make contact
The Day of the Deadline
Here is where the former Deputy Prime Minister
and the criminal will make contact
in front of the monument at Kaze no Mori Park.
As this quadrillion yen ransom
cannot possibly be prepared
Mr. Kunitake, in apology to the criminal
is expected to present his reconstruction plan.
Your lunch.
You made it for me?
It's just a sandwich.
Thank you.
You sure you haven't left anything behind?
Yes.
You know...
This.
It's for you.
A lucky four-leaf clover.
I want you to have it.
It'll bring you happiness.
It'll protect you so you can run away.
See? So keep it.
You promise?
It's a very important promise.
Yeah.
Don't cry.
Off you go.
Just recently
this one police officer gave me water.
He ran all the way to the vending machine to buy it.
Take it with this.
- Sorry. I'll pay...
- Oh no, it's fine.
If it weighs on you,
then just put 100 yen in a donation box for me.
But are you really alright?
Police and politicians
all the people who make up this country
if they had kind hearts like that one officer
maybe this country would become a better place.
Maybe it would.
Yeah.
Run away, okay?
Somewhere far.
Run somewhere really far
and super pretty, okay?
Good bye.
Good bye.
Got it?
If the enemy makes any suspicious moves,
make a shoot-to-kill order.
Got it?!
We've just arrived.
Got it.
When we reviewed the surveillance on Hashimoto Saori,
if you could please...
You did it!
That proves it.
Tension is building here on-site.
Although the arranged time is quickly approaching
Mr. Furuichi, what are your estimates
on the chances of the criminal appearing?
Well, the chances of that one quadrillion yen
being exchanged are, first off, none
but I have trouble believing
the kidnapper will make an appearance.
You can't talk your way out of this one.
You were meeting Mayu in private.
Furthermore, our suspect, Ito Naoya, is with you.
You too are a member of
The Leaders of the Revolution
You're wrong!
That man did it all on his own.
I never thought...
I never thought he'd actually kidnap her...
Please explain.
We were just joking around.
I found a blog run by someone
with a grudge against Kunitake
and said, ""I know his granddaughter.""
""Why don't you kidnap her as a threat?""
- As we thought...
- Who would think he'd actually do it?!
Meeting Mayu behind her father's back
and bad-mouthing her family...
That was enough for me.
But then... then that girl!
That girl? You mean Mayu?
That girl said she wanted to meet him again...
Beyond that, I know nothing.
I was not involved!
This is Kataoka.
We've pinpointed Ito Naoya's hideout.
He rented out a closed shop
on the black market using cash.
Mr. Odagiri, these...
Mr. Kataoka, he's fleeing the country!
Head toward the airport.
From the Metropolitan Police Department
The hostage, Shinoda Mayu, has arrived at school.
The hostage has been released
before the arranged time.
What could be the meaning of this?
It's curious.
But this may mean that
the criminal's plan is drawing to an end.
Well, perhaps the criminal was afraid of arrest
and ended the crime in the middle?
In that case, the criminal should be
making their escape now.
We're going back.
Turn the car around.
What?
My granddaughter is in custody now!
There's no need for me to go out!
- Quickly, turn the car around!
- Just wait a minute!
The people would not be satisfied.
Are you trying to deceive the nation again?
What are you saying?
I will ask her about what happened.
- Mayu...
- I was blindfolded the whole time
so I do not know where I was.
Did you see the kidnapper's face?
I was blindfolded the whole time,
so I did not see them.
But you were eating meals, weren't you?
I ate alone, so I did not see them.
Excuse me.
Mayu! Mayu!
Mayu!
I'm so glad. I'm so glad.
Mayu...
Mayu is saying that she did not
see the kidnapper's face.
That's a lie.
Shinoda Mayu is covering for Ito Naoya.
I think so too.
It's common for criminals and victims to form a bond.
No.
Shinoda Mayu is Naoya's accomplice.
What?
The Leaders of the Revolution are
Ito Naoya and Shinoda Mayu.
This is not a regular political crime.
It was a revolution that two lonely people
put their lives toward.
So Ito brought the message to the mother for Mayu?
He wanted to put an end to her lonliness.
But he doesn't have much life left.
So he wanted to appeal to the mother's conscience.
Because the mother responded to that
Mayu's revolution came to an end.
That's why she went back to school.
In that case Mr. Kataoka
where is Ito's revolution,
his own revolution, headed?
With so little of his life left...
From the Metropolitan Police Department:
The criminal has appeared at the site.
Get back!
Everyone get back!
Don't push!
Alright, get back!
Get back!
I am The Leaders of the Revolution!
It's dangerous, please move away!
Stay back!
Don't move!
Mr. Kunitake, please wait!
Mr. Kunitake!
Mr. Kunitake!
Kunitake!
Don't you run away!
Can you confidently say that you've ever given
a single thought to this country?!
Can you say it wasn't for your own profit
or self-preservation?!
We are endlessly taking measures
toward fiscal reconstruction.
Then why is it that you can't make
one granddaughter happy?!
That you can't give her hope?!
It's not just her!
There are so many children
who can't imagine a bright future!
And among them children who lose their lives!
Mayu, the person who kidnapped you,
that's definitely him, right?
Run away, okay?
Run far away, okay?
You liar...
Huh?
Liar!
This man is a liar.
I don't know him.
Mayu?
Everything he says is a lie!
Because I wasn't even kidnapped.
What do you mean by that?
I was never kidnapped.
I just went on a vacation by myself!
So don't believe anything this person says!
Shinoda Mayu is Ito's accomplice.
It was a revolution that two lonely people
put their lives toward.
I understand.
I understand, Mayu.
Mom, I want to take the test.
I came back so I could take the test.
Teacher, please let me take the test.
Don't come any closer!
Your voice has sufficiently reached the nation!
All of Japan has had their eyes on you!
Isn't that enough?
If nothing changes,
what does it matter if my voice is heard?
Why did this country become such economic hell?
Why are you sacrificing the next generations?
The children who grow up watching us adults
can't we give them hope?!
Yeah!
Stop caring only for older generations!
Stop piling this pressure on us!
Yeah!
That's to all of you!
Don't fall for adults' standards!
The future has to be created by the young!
Raise your voices.
Unless there is change, don't you ever give up.
Of course I'm to blame too.
I don't expect things to change just because
I've expressed my discontent.
But that's not good enough!
In order to change this country
we first need to change ourselves!
If we run away from this
what will happen to even younger children?!
That's what I've finally realized.
The children's future
can only be saved by us!
Don't you die!
Ito Naoya!
Don't you dare die!
If you die, won't that girl will be sad?
Drop the knife.
You're not alone anymore.
But I want to be with you!
Because you're my family, Naoto!
Thanks, Mayu.
You still have a future.
Even if this short time feels like sand slipping away
you still have time to share the future with Mayu!
And with that
the world isn't that much of a lost cause.
I know.
I met this one police officer
and I thought just that.
You see!
As long as you live, there is hope!
So...
use your hearts and words to fight!
If you fear your challenges, you've been defeated!
If adults can all go to hell
then it's you who need to break open that door!
Show that spirit to your own children.
Don't make that same mistake!
Don't forget your pride as people!
And in your heart...
have pride!
Don't do it!
Ito!
Ito!
Ito, stay with me!
Ito!
Ito!
Hey! Ito!
Ito!
Ito! Stay with me, Ito!

Tell you what.

I meant that it's a shame for them
to have to take on the likes of you.

-Hey!
Really, can you please cut that out.
Come back someday, alright.
Goodbye.
Excuse me.
As of today, I am assigned to
Investigation Section One of the Metropolitan Police.
Ishizaki Manabu, right?
Yes!
For the basics, talk to those young folks.
Got it.
Um... I'd like to apologize...
I encountered that past kidnapper,
Ito Naoya, on the street
and let him get away.
I am deeply sorry.
Did you lose him?
Oh, no.
He looked pained, so I bought him some water
so he could take his medicine
and we parted.
Um...?
It's people like you
who may be the ones to change the world.
Be sure to make up for that one loss.
Yes, sir!
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
You scared me, wearing that thing.
But my face could've been seen if I didn't wear it.
Look here.
You're overdoing it.
Well, I've been kidnapped, haven't I?
It looks too fake!
One more.
Don't rattle it so much.
Don't worry.
No one's coming in.
Okay.
- I'll be going.
- Come back soon.
A change of clothes.
It can't be comfortable to stay in uniform.
But these are so ugly!
Don't complain.
I had a hard time too, y'know.
They kept saying things like,
""Is this for your daughter?""
I forgot to buy your underwear.
That much I brought myself.
Pervert.
Hey, don't call me a pervert...
I will be changing, so please do not look!
I'm glad you brought them.
Underwear would've been impossible after all.
Are you going to continue to be a politician?
Of course I am!
You think I can quit such a rich business?
Pirating.
I'm good, aren't I?
I guess so.
For a kid.
I'm good at cooking, aren't I?
I guess so.
For a guy.
You, write a letter.
Two versions.

and one to be read only by your mom.

1,A 2nd Chance (2011) - full transcript,A young girl and her coach overcome adversity to make their way into the National Australian Gymnastics Squad.,"Nice and tall. Smiling.
Good.
Now line up along the line.
Very good.
Now today, I want to see
your best cartwheel.
So I'm gonna spread out nice
and tall. Point my toes.
Just like that. Easy.
Alright. Your turn now.
Spread out.
Off you go.
Well, that was very good.
You still have exquisite control
despite not doing gym for years.
Bev. No my time is well and
truly past...
But I do love coaching.
- Well, that's what I wanted
to...
talk to you about.
- Very good handstand Emma.
I was hoping
you could take over coaching
the level 6 gymnasts for me?
I couldn't possibly.
Why can't you continue?
Oh well, you know...
I've not been well and I have to
have a few tests done.
Plus the girls need someone
younger, they need someone
who...
can devote more time and energy
to them than I can.
I would love to help.
But I just couldn't.
I understand. But you'll
have to deal with it one day.
Sorry Bev.
I'm sorry girls. She can't.
What's the matter with you?
Is it because of me
she won't coach?
- Oh, Maddy, no, it's nothing
like that, it's just... [Coughs]
...she has her reasons,
that's all.
Are you OK?
- Mmmm... Yeah, I'm fine.
That's it for tonight.
Time to pack up and go home.
I'm heading off Bev. You OK
to lock up?
Yeah, that's fine Kate.
- See you tomorrow.
[Footsteps]
Doh!
Bev?
Bev!
Bev! What is it?
- I can't breathe!
[Labored breathing]
OK, don't panic.
Bev?
- Oh, Kate.
Thanks for coming.
How are you?
I'm getting better.
I can breathe now. [laughing]
But... They've...
they've scheduled the
operation for tomorrow.
Wow!
That's better sooner than
later, get you back to normal.
I'm sorry to ask again,
but could you please...
... look after and train
the level 6 girls for me?
Of course. How can I refuse now?
[Laughing]
But only until you're better,
ok?
OK.
Thank you Kate.
Thank you.
OK. Erin? Kayla, Maddy?
Lets see what you
can do on the floor.
Really, really good girls.
Maddy...just focus on your own
moves and you'll be terrific.
How've have you been going
in the competitions?
Winning easily?
Us?
You must be joking!
We get caned by
Saints every time.
Saints huh?
They were never any
good in my day.
We'll have to see about that.
Come on. We've got work to do.
Guess what's first lesson
today for Kayla?
Hmm... Let me think.
You know exactly what it is.
Wild Guess... Dance?
I hate dance! I never
get the moves right.
At least it's your last
lesson today.
Yes! Fortunately. Did I tell you
that I hate dance?
Yes. Constantly!
So, What do you think of our new
coach Miss Kate Jones?
Really good girls...
She's alright I guess.
What about you Maddy?
I liked her. I reckon
she'll put in for us.
She's only doing it for Bev.
She'll drop us as soon as Bev's
OK.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh-oh....
Hi girls. Coming to the State
Championships on the weekend?
What's it to you?
You're going, aren't you Maddy?
Yeah, we all are.
Great! You girls are so hopeless
you make us look more fantastic!
If that's possible.
Right Girls?
One day I'm gonna show her.
- Show her what?
Just show her.
Nearly Maddy. Try it again.
You can do it!
It's no use.
I'm not good enough!
Maddy, try it again.
This time, when you get to here,
use the momentum to push.
Don't hold back.
Now push!
There see. You're nearly there.
OK. Now we're going to finish
off on your floor routines.
Erin, Maddy let's go.
[Music]
Real good Erin. Real good.
That's it. Keep it tight.
OK Maddy. Your turn. Remember
don't hold back.
Just focus and go for it!
[Music]
[Clapping]
Great Maddy!
That's it! Believe in yourself.
Competition tomorrow, hey girls?
Should be interesting.
Never quite feel you're
prepared.
Does anyone need a ride?
What, all three of you?
Don't your parents come?
My mum and dad
aren't really interested.
My mum and dad normally come
and we always take Erin...
... but tomorrow they're going
to my brother's sports day.
That's rides for 2 of you.
What about you Maddy?
My dad always comes
but he has to work.
He'll pop in later though.
OK. What about your mum?
My mum died when I was eight.
Sorry, Maddy.
Yeah. Me too.
[Music]
Really stretch out.
Straight backs.
Straight backs.
Straight backs on the way down.
Good afternoon everyone.
Welcome to Round 1 of the
women's gymnastics competition.
[Clapping]
Please welcome the judges
for today
with supervising head
judge Sally Peterson.
[Clapping]
Mr Peterson, the prognosis
is not good.
The concussion will pass
in a few days.
We still need to do some testing
but I have to tell you...
... it doesn't look good.
[Crying]
Hey, Sally. Kate's here.
Come on in, Kate.
[Crying] Get out! Get out!
I don't want to see her!
I never want to see her again.
[Crying]
[Crying] It's not fair!
Kate! We're Starting,
it's this way, C'mon!
Alright. C'mon. Go.
[60's surfie music]
[Blurgh]
[Clapping,
music throughout competition]
Do your dismount.
[Clapping]
It's OK. You've still have
the floor to do yet.
[Clapping]
- That was so good!
- Unbelievable!
Everyone's like, Oh my god!
The dance was just perfect.
Just brilliant.
[Clapping]
That was fantastic!
Really? Truly?
Oh yeah! Gold medal material!
12.8?... That's crap!
Erin!
12.8?... 4th?...
What is this?
[Clapping]
Hey, girls... congratulations.
You did it again.
Told you all that training
would pay off.
It's good to see you.
Well done congratulations!
Hey, Good job with your team.
Last girl was a little unlucky.
Unlucky?
Sally's a damn cheat.
Whoa, whoa, Sally's
one of the top judges.
What would you know?
Bev! Are you OK?
Should you be here?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I just wanted to get out for
a bit and Maddy's dad was
kind enough to pick me up
and bring me down here.
Oh.
Did you see what Sally
did to Maddy?
After all these years!
Maybe she can't forgive me,
but to take it out on Maddy?
I'm determined
to find a way for Maddy to win.
Even with Sally's Bias.
I've got to train the girls
better than the other teams.
Does this mean you'll
keep coaching them?
Oh, the girls are OK,
and I don't mind coaching.
Now with Sally...
I'm not going
to let her beat me.
Well you'll need assistance
from a top coach.
You should ask Shane Fuller.
He is a strength
and technique coach.
Great idea!
Do you have his number?
No need. He's...
He's just over there.
Oh no!
Why? What happened?
Don't ask.
I'm too embarrassed.
Are you sure he's that good?
Probably no one better.
[Sigh] Alright... here goes.
-[Chuckles]
[Background chatter]
Hey, great job on your
judging again, Sally.
Gee, you were lucky to get
the silver with that
seasick routine of yours,
Maddy's was really good!
Maddy's was good!
Better than Chelsea's.
Hey Maddy?
Gee, that was a
great floor routine.
Thanks?
Even with your best performance
all you could manage was 4th?
Why don't you just do yourself
a favor and quit?
The closest thing that you'll
get to a medal is that metal
in your mouth.
[knock at door]
[Door Opens]
You OK?
Yeah. Just the kids at school
are making fun of me again.
I wish I was more
like the other kids.
I know other kids
can be mean.
I'm so proud of you though.
And you know?
You're so like your mum.
If she was here
well I know she'd just
be beaming with pride.
I miss her so much dad.
Me too kiddo.
Me too.
Come on girls!
Stick with it, Maddy.
Kate, why won't you reconsider
getting Shane in?
It would really help
you and the girls!
Nope. I can do it on my own.
Why not take this
weekend off, come and
watch the boys competition?
I mean, if you won't
ask for help
you might as well pick
up some pointers by watching.
Maddy! Really!
Can't you stick
to your own area?
Actually, we could use a break.
The girls are really struggling.
Especially Maddy.
They told me how Chelsea
ripped into her.
Ohh.
OK. Take a break.
C'mon. Let's go for a drink.
[Music throughout competition]
See the strength?
And the technique?
Yeah, I see it!
Look, there's Shane.
You could still ask
him for help!
- No!
Bev, no!
- Shane? Smile! Shane?
Hello, Shane.
- Hi, Beverly.
Your boys are performing
very well.
Yeah, so far so good.
It's not over yet though.
This is Kate Jones.
- Nice to meet you.
Haven't we met before?
No. Well we sort of crossed
paths at the last competition.
Yes. Now I remember.
- Um Kate wanted to speak
to you.
Yeah I was...
I was wondering if, maybe...
Look, I'll help you.
-You will?
Yeah sure, look.
It's just a small thing.
It just happened.
Don't worry about it.
I accept your apology.
Apology? Apologize?
Well, that's what you we're
going to ask wasn't it?
Last time we met you were
insulting towards Sally
as I remember?
No. Sally?
Well, I think you're
the one who owes the apology.
[Laughs]
I don't see what for?
Look, I've got to get back
to the competition.
Another time maybe.
That went well.
Conceited, arrogant, prat!
Thanks a lot for that!
It's not my fault you can't
talk to a man.
[Clapping]
Yeah!
So proud of you boys!
Good work today!
So, did you enjoy that?
I am glad we went.
Yes. It's good to see the way
they deal with things.
You're right as always.
- Oh no.
I've left my bag behind.
One of the girls will get it
for you.
Girls?
- No! no... It's fine.
Are you sure?
Yes! Go ahead, get the car
and meet me back here.
OK.
Shane!
Hey, Beverley.
How are you?
I meant to ask you before.
Oh, I'm getting better,
just one day at a time.
Hey, congratulations
on the win today.
Ah, the boys did it.
It wasn't me.
[Chuckle]
I think you're being
a little modest.
I was wondering if you could
help our girls team
with specialized training?
Well sure, but isn't Kate
in charge?
Oh, yes, yes she is.
and she's doing a terrific job,
It's just that.
the girls need some extra
strength and technique training.
And Kate was keen to ask you
but after her little
altercations with you.
now she feels she can't.
You mean today and
at the girls gym?
[Chuckle]
Ah, tell her it was nothing.
Tell her to forget about it.
Sure. I'll help.
Yeah! Look at that form!
One more for good luck.
That's beautiful!
This time I want to see your
full run up with a half
twist through the air, OK?
Yeah, Maddy, nice and strong.
Beautiful momentum through
that run up.
This time I want you to go
through your full run up
and then go into a full twist
while you're in the air, OK?
A layout backsault with
a full twist?
I could never do that!
- Oh, I reckon you could.
You've got everything.
Everything you've just
done alright?
So you've got your arms,
and then head.
C'mon, Maddy.
- C'mon.
Go for it girl.
- GFG!
GFG?
Go for it girl. GFG!
- Oh yeah! Sweet!
C'mon, Maddy.
-C'mon. GFG!
GFG! GFG! GFG!
GFG! GFG! GFG!
Woah!
-Maddy!
Maddy, are you OK?
Maddy, that was a lay out
backsault with nearly
a full twist!
I haven't been able to get you
to do a 1/2 twist let alone
the full one!
How on earth?
Oh, now it all makes sense.
Let me guess.
Beverley asked you
here yesterday, right?
Yeah.
Can he help us?
- He wants to. Please?
- Please, Please, Please?
- He wants to help us.
Alright.
- Yes!
I just hope Shane knows
what he's in for!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Thank you!
Alright. Careful, careful!
Alright. No more full twists OK?
Right, back to it. You're going
to have to rest that for a week!
Finish off with some
floor exercises.
That's good. Nice and strong.
Yeah, Maddy, you can sit out.
Nice and straight,
nice and strong. Beautiful.
OK, straight into dish. Quick!
One... Two...
- OK. That'll do for today.
Wow, look the girls are
really good.
Especially Maddy.
Yeah, they are good.
I think Maddy's exceptional.
She just lacks confidence.
Do you think I could bring my
boys around & combine training?
That way I'd get more time
with them.
That sounds really good!
I mean, whatever will help the
girls. I really want them
to win the next comp.
- Yeah.
Oh.
Here they are.
[Inaudible whispering,
and laughing]
Alright, girls,
let me introduce my boys team.
This is Matthew. This is
Harrison. And this is Joshua.
Duh! They are our friends
on Facebook.
Erin, manners please.
Well sorry. But they are friends
and Josh goes to our school.
So we do know them.
- Of course! Facebook!
Starting out with warm-up
stretches.
In a line facing each other.
And arm swings.
- Feet nice and close together.
C'mon Josh, you know this.
Nice and tight up
through the body.
Left arm... Good.
[Crickets]
[Sigh]
Shane. Hi.
- Kate. Hi, what time is it?
Oh, yeah, it is a bit late.
Yeah. What's up anyway?
Um. Well, there's only 2 weeks
to the next competition.
Can I met with you to discuss
the girls' progress?
Is that all you rang for? Yeah,
but only if it's over dinner.
Well, fine.
But I get
to pick the restaurant.
Deal! Tomorrow night at 6:00?
Great, I'll text you where
to meet me.
Thanks.
Ahh. This is not exactly
what I had in mind.
Yeah, I suspected
what you had in mind,
which is why I chose here.
Oh really?
What did I have in mind?
Here, I've ordered for you.
So. What can we do to give
the girls a real edge?
Well, to advance they need
strength development.
Aha.
I know you can get it
out of the boys apparatus.
We could train them
on the boys equipment?
That's a bit radical.
Has it worked in the past?
- I don't know!
I've never done it before.
[Laughing]
The boys equipment!?!
Yes. The boys equipment.
Now boys, this is all about
helping the girls.
Matthew, you're with Kayla.
Harry, you're with Erin.
And Josh, you're with Maddy.
Alright. Let's get into it.
Did I mention you are all teams?
Whoever does the most chin ups,
pull ups on the rings,
and dips on the bars will
win the prize.
What's the prize?
You are direct aren't you?
I want to know what the prize is
if I'm gonna have to work with
him!
Rest assured, it will be good.
- It better be.
C'mon.
Prize? When did you come
up with that?
When none of them moved.
I've got no idea what to
use as a prize.
-[laughter]
It shouldn't be hard, yeah?
Well, if you can do it it can't
be that hard.
Whoops!
Argh!
Tst.
[Doorbell]
[Doorbell]
Yes?
Is... Is Maddy at home?
Maybe.
Who might you be?
I'm Joshua.
I'm helping Maddy at the gym.
Hmm.
May I please speak to Maddy?
Sure. Come on in.
I'll get Maddy for you.
Josh! What are you doing here?
I think that's pretty obvious!
He's come to see you kiddo.
Spruce yourself up!
Don't want to look like the cat
dragged you in.
Well, I've got some things to do
out in the out in the shed.
Nice to meet you Joshua.
I'll be out in the garage
if you need me, Maddy.
You done your homework yet?
Yeah, that was easy.
I love working out those
problems in my head.
Really?
- You?
I'm pretty hopeless.
I could sort of help you a bit.
- Oh cool...
I'll go get my books.
Sorry.
Ouch!
Well, I was gonna use my head.
But not quite like that!
[Inaudible chatter]
Well, what do you reckon Hunter?
Hey?
Have we given them enough time?
C'mon. Let's go.
Could you really not work
this out?
I just got a bit confused
alright?
It's full reception.
Don't be mean.
How's it going guys, alright?
- Yep...
Fine dad.
Yeah, good, Mr Cornell.
So, what are you working on?
- It's actually very
interesting.
Did you see Josh is with
that little cow Maddy?
Nuh. Who? What?
Maddy and Joshua Phelps.
Well, Joshua Phelps.
Like, who cares?
I do! I'm gonna teach her
a lesson.
Don't you sit next to him in IT?
- Yeah.
I want you to swap with me.
What are you doing?
Catherine sits there.
- Oh, I asked to swap.
I hoped you could help me
with the assignment.
You? As if you need help.
Well this web stuff's too hard
for me.
How do you get pictures in it?
That's easy. You just--
Thank you for your help, Josh.
- That's alright.
What are you doing?
Did she see?
- Oh, yeah, big time!
She ran off behind
the classroom.
Sucks to be her!
What's up with you today?
What's up with her?
She saw you with Chelsea!
That was nothing.
I just helped her!
Well getting her to kiss you
isn't nothing!
It's not my fault.
I didn't do anything!
You know Chelsea hates Maddy?
- Says who?
Don't you get it? She'll do any
thing to have a go at Maddy.
No she wouldn't,
she's not like that at all.
I don't care about Maddy.
I think Chelsea really likes me.
Yeah, Chelsea really likes
you...Not!
It's different now!
She knows me.
Yeah right, sure.
Nice, Harry. Nice and strong
through those shoulders sets.
Josh and Maddy didn't seem to be
getting on. Did you notice?
Can't say that I did.
Yeah, nice, Josh, that's it.
Keep that sustained.
Have you got the invite?
Yes, I have it.
- Mum? Dad?
You'll be coming down today
won't you?
Of course we will darling
but we have to go to your
father's business lunch first.
You'll come down straight after?
Yes, we'll try.
They're not coming are they?
[Music]
C'mon, Kayla! GFG!
GFG! GFG! GFG!
[Music throughout routine]
Well done, Kayla.
Go, Erin! GFG GFG.
- Go, Erin! GFG, Erin! GFG, GFG.
C'mon, Erin!
C'mon, Erin, keep it tight!
Show it off.
That was so good.
-Well done.
Alright, Maddy?
- C'mon, Maddy! GFG!
C'mon, Maddy! Keep it tight!
- GFG!
No.
Well done, Maddy!
Congratulations gymnasts.
Well done!
[Audience applause]
Thank you, gymnasts.
We have with us today
a special guest.
Tom Johansson from the National
Selectors Committee.
Let's welcome Tom.
[Applause]
Thank you.
What a fantastic competition
that's been here today!
With some very talented
gymnasts.
That brings me to the reason
why I'm here.
The national selectors
will be appointing
the winning gymnast
in the next competition straight
into the national squad.
Also, I have some good news
for the judges
and, in particular, your very
own Sally Peterson.
Come forward, Sally.
There's a vacancy on the
International judges panel.
And I'm pleased to announce
Sally has been nominated
to be our representative.
So, congratulations Sally,
and thank you everyone.
[Applause]
See you in round 3.
Sally, can I speak to you
afterwards if that's OK?
Sure.
That little witch Maddy.
She isn't that good at all.
Yeah. That little witch Maddy,
she isn't even that good at all.
God!
- What?
Makes me so mad! Maddy won that
medal fair and square!
Saints? As if!
You know? They do look like
winners though.
I think it's time we had
an extreme make over.
What?
C'mon, let's go find Beverley!
So, to get endorsement
into the national committee
three members will
assess your judging
They judge you and gymnasts
and compare scores.
Yes and I have to be within .2
of their score to be nominated.
Correct. But there is one
other problem.
Problem? What's that?
Someone's lodged a complaint
against you.
A complaint? What about?
Bias judging.
What!
I can't believe it!
We can't endorse your nomination
whilst this complaint is lodged.
Who lodged it?
You know I can't say
until the hearings been set.
I can't imagine who
would do this?
Can you tell me who?
- You know I can't tell you.
You know those are
the procedures.
However, it would be better
if it just went away.
Tom, this is my whole future.
There's Beverley and
who's the other coach?
Kate Jones isn't it?
Didn't Kate and you used to be
good friends?
You could say that.
Pity you're not all good friends
now isn't it?
Kate Jones!
I want to speak to you!
Sally?
You made a complaint against
me of my judging
of your precious little
protege Maddy Cornell?
Sally. I didn't.
But I should.
Kate. Don't lie to me now.
You lied when I had the
accident in the gym.
Don't lie to me again.
I didn't.
It wasn't my fault.
Yes it was.
You pushed me.
The pit's been emptied so be
careful not to go near it, OK?
I had my hand on your shoulder.
You were holding on to me.
We were having such good fun.
No you won't.
Then you fell.
You slipped.
I don't know.
I just can't remember.
You may not remember
but I sure do.
Because I live with it
every day.
If you try and destroy my future
I'll make sure your little
protege's future is
destroyed too!
What?
You wouldn't.
Not to Maddy?
- Just try me!
Kate?
What was that all about?
It's the accident.
She still blames me.
I think I pushed her.
Shh. You said you couldn't
remember what happened.
I know. I can't but Sally does.
She said I pushed her.
Oh, Kate. Shh.
I'm sure if you had,
you would have remembered.
I don't know. I just...
I don't know!
Blow. That's a good girl.
- [Crying Giggle]
Try not to think about Sally.
You should be thrilled with
how the girls went today.
Especially Maddy.
Two silvers, not bad, hey?
- Yeah and the winner
goes straight into the
national team! Woo-hoo!
I think that's reserved
for Chelsea.
I don't know, if you take
Sally's bias out of it.
It's a very close thing.
Do you think?
- Aha.
Don't give up on her now.
Anything could happen.
Yeah, I guess.
Something troubling Maddy
though.
I don't know.
I can't quite pinpoint it.
Good, Kayla.
OK. That's it for today girls.
Really good today girls.
Really, really good.
Now, home and relax,
you deserve it.
Hey, Maddy?
I think it's time we shared
the joy of Maddy's puppy love
with the whole school.
Maddy has a puppy?
I love puppies!
No. Catherine. Beccy.
Same as last time,
we'll get all the year 7's
to watch Maddy's face
when I kiss Josh.
But? Haven't we done enough
to her?
Beccy. The next comp winner will
get into the national squad
do you think I'm gonna give
her a chance at that?
But!
- Now!
What about the puppy?
Maddy wait up. Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You've been acting so funny
lately.
I thought winning the silver
would snap you out of it.
I've just had other things
on my mind.
If you don't want me around
I'll go hang with Chelsea.
Fine. You do that.
[Inaudible chatter]
[Student laughter]
What are you trying to do?
Nothing that concerns you but
you played your part well!
I didn't do anything!
I thought we were friends?
You and me? I don't think so.
I'm not desperate!
You just used me to hurt Maddy?
- You're the sucker!
I bet you set this up as well.
All just to get at Maddy?
What has she ever done to you?
- That's not the point.
You are so up yourself Chelsea!
Who'd wanna be with you?
I don't and no one else
would either!
It's no wonder your parents
never want to be with you.
Mum?
Mum? Dad?
Gran?
Mum? Dad?
I'm quitting!
You can't do that.
I've worked so hard.
I mean we have done too much
work for you to quit!
The final competition
and the National Squad?
Not now!
Maddy!
- Kate!
Why don't you want her to quit?
Is it for her benefit or yours?
Maddy?
[Knock at door]
Maddy, may I come in?
Wow.
A gold medal?
Look at the inscription.
Equal first place,
Kate Jones Under 12,
National Championships?
Who'd you come equal with?
Sally Peterson.
Is she the judge
in the wheelchair?
Yeah, that's right.
We were both heading towards
representing our country.
Then Sally had her accident
and could never compete again.
Out of sympathy to her
I decided never
to compete again either.
The girls and I always wondered.
Is that why you didn't want
to coach us?
Yeah. Sort of.
Now. It's your choice
whether you quit or not.
And I have to admit coaching
you has given me
a second chance to see
a dream fulfilled.
But I don't want you to be like
me and make a wrong decision.
Quit for the right reasons.
You know I see you look at
yourself.
I see you feel like you're
not like the other kids.
I'm telling you Maddy.
Your talent, your physique,
most of all your heart
means that you are 10 times
more talented than Chelsea
and all her friends
put together.
Quit if you want to.
But don't be like me and
waste your talent because
of what others think.
What about the medal?
Keep it.
That's right.
Swapping over.
Good. And shoulder stretch.
I think we both should have
a second chance.
Go on then!
Maddy?
Maddy! Maddy, wait up.
I realize I was wrong!
I shouldn't have made fun of you
like that.
What are you doing now, Chelsea?
Still trying to milk more fun
out of it?
No, I was trying to apologize.
Maddy? Sorry about yesterday.
I didn't know!
Spare me the details.
I saw what happened.
But I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Well, you did!
And I don't want you
around anymore.
I told Kate and Shane I don't
want you at training either.
But it wasn't my fault!
Maddy?
Maddy? Maddy?
Maddy?
What you doing, buddy?
Ahhh, glutton for more
punishment, eh?
I heard what you said to Chelsea
after her stunt. Good for you!
Doesn't do me any good,
Maddy won't even talk to me.
Come back after training
tonight. I'll talk to her.
OK?
You'd help?
Sure. I'll be back.
Maddy?
Maddy.
Even if you're right you still
have to forgive and move on.
But!
Did you know he gave Chelsea
a serve after you left?
No. Erin and Kayla said
something, but I didn't listen.
Well, from what they told me
that boy deserves a gold medal.
Um. Do you want to walk me home?
- Sure!
Forgive and move on,
or you just hurt yourself.
Let me guess.
Good advice for me and Sally.
It would be good for the
both of you.
I mean, for what it's worth.
Well, whatever happens next
comp, I'll try and patch things
up.
It won't solve this complaint
against her though.
What do you mean?
She blames me for a complaint
lodged against her.
That's what our
argument was about.
I thought you said it was
about the accident.
Well yeah that too.
But it was the complaint
that started it off.
Oh dear.
Don't you worry about it.
I'll just have to sort it out
with her anyway.
I think I could do with a dose
of that advice myself.
You lodged the complaint?
- Shh! I saw what she was
doing to Maddy
and it wasn't fair.
And I couldn't stand by
and do nothing.
Oh Beverley! This whole time
she's been blaming me
and it was you!
Oh, I'm sorry Kate.
I thought
I was doing the right thing.
It's fine.
- Really?
I sort of didn't mind her harsh
judging of Maddy.
I mean, I hated it and it made
me really angry but
it was actually very
motivating.
Pushed me & Maddy beyond what
I thought we were capable of.
A silver lining to a dark cloud.
Yeah, you're lucky.
- [Chuckle]
What are we gonna do?
I'll make things right.
One... two... three...
and turn.
Beautiful.
One... two...
And turn back. Yes...
[Phone ringing]
- Hello.
- Shane, it's me.
- Kate.
- I've been doing some
thinking about the girls.
And there's only 3 weeks until
the next comp.
And I want to talk to you
about them but not in front of
them.
- OK... Where?
I don't mind.
Hmm. OK but only
if I pick the place!
Great.
This is cozy.
- I take it you approve?
Well, I'm not adverse to
intimacy and class.
I can see that.
You look fantastic!
Thank you.
How can we improve the girls
chances at the next comp?
I thought that's what we
were training for?
Well, yeah of course it is,
but now
I can actually
see them winning.
OK. Um.
Are they all doing extra
skills on the apparatus?
Well yeah, as many as they
can but
Maddy's struggling with
her kips move.
Erin with her run up
for vault.
Kayla with footwork on beam.
Well, Maddy could do a layout
backsault with a full twist.
for an extra .5 on her
floor routine?
True, but she sprained her ankle
and was out for a week.
the last time
she attempted that.
- Hmm.
- Maddy's kips.
Erin's vault and
Kayla's footwork?
I've got an idea.
[Clears throat]
Hey, yeah, it's Shane, yeah,
long time.
I know this is short notice
but I was wondering if...
Alright. It's set.
What's set?
- Uh, no, no, no, no, no...
That's a surprise!
Be at the
athletic stadium at 7:00 am.
with the girls, if you dare.
Now, let's talk about you
for a change.
[Chatter]
The beam?
- Excuse me! The beam is--
Is that right?
- Yes!
And men don't do it because--
- I bet you I could!
Come on. You'll fall off!
- Let me show you.
Oh my god,
this is so embarrassing.
There's people watching!
No. Lengthen.
Up!
Very nice.
- Dismount?
Ohh, very good--and extend.
Well done.
They liked you.
- Yeah? What'd you think?
Um. I'd give you another
six years!
Kate?
What are we doing here?
[Phone rings]
I'm about to find out.
- Kate, are you there?
- Yes. We're here.
What's happening?
- OK. If you look around
there should be an athlete
waving toward you?
I see her.
- Put me on speaker.
Girls, this is Tamsyn Lewis.
Australian champion runner
who's been to the Olympics
and World Championships!
This is especially for you,
Erin!
Fantastic! That's great!
- Hi, girls!
You must be Kate?
Yes.
I've spoken to Shane.
And he wants me to help you
with speed and acceleration.
Let's go and work on
some technique.
Now sprinters focus on using
their arms to generate speed.
They pump their arms up and down
and they focus on driving out.
On your marks.
Set. Go!
Let's go again, remembering
what I've taught you.
Erin, that's really good.
We're gonna have to move your
cone back, you're much faster!
Set.
Kate, they're doing very well.
I reckon there's one more
thing that would help.
Resistance training.
[Phone ringing]
- Shane?
Kate?
Now for Maddy's kip. Tomorrow
meet me at my mate's warehouse.
What are we doing here?
Aww. Box off, box on.
Who does he think he is?
Mr. Miyagi I think?
Who?
Mr Ho to you!
Who?
[Sigh] Girls.
This is Dean Lukin!
Australia's only Gold medalist
in the Olympics
for weight lifting!
Cool! Do we get to do some
weight lifting?
Shane's explained we need to do
a little bit of weight training.
So, what we're gonna do,
is lift some of these cartons.
No! Straight arms.
This is gonna be hard.
After a week?
More than you know.
Oh, Maddy?
Straight arms. GFG!
OK, girls, that should
about do it!
Alright. To the gym.
Let's put it to the test.
What? Now?
- No time like the present.
OK, Maddy.
Let's see your kip.
Now?
My arms are dropping off.
Yes. Now!
Kate?
You heard the man.
Let's go.
Maddy, I'm serious.
One swing, then into kip, ok?
Wow!
- Did you see that. [Laughter].
Great, Maddy!
This time, try again and connect
your handstand.
Wow! That was amazing!
- That was so amazing!
Nice one, Shane!
OK. Now for my next miracle,
Kayla's footwork. [Whispers]
Where? Where tell us! C'mon!
It's a secret. Not telling!
[Waltz Music]
Now, these are for you.
These are boots.
They have solid toes too?
They're called steel caps,
and trust me, you'll need them.
So, this is Kayla our troubled
footwork gymnast.
Work your magic! Hopefully
not too many injuries.
I'm sure we'll be fine.
-[laughs]
He's got boots on as well?
- Yes. For his protection!
Good luck, Chris.
Sorry... oh...
- It's OK.
Sorry! Oops! Ahh.
- Over this way. And....
And again.
That's OK start again. Sorry!
Wait! Can you like, slow down?
Well, that's the best I can do
with them in 3 weeks.
I think you are a regular little
miracle worker.
I... I...
I do have one more surprise.
I thought Maddy needed something
that stood out music wise
for her floor routine.
So I had this made for you.
Oh Maddy really.
[Floor routine music]
Wow! What's fantastic!
Can you play that again?
[Music is restarted]
This goes perfectly with her
routine!
I'll get her used
to it in the morning.
Just a few little changes.
She's gonna love this!
Did I say only 1 more surprise?
I was really hoping for two.
Chelsea,
don't get your hopes up.
They're really busy today.
Girls!
The warm up has started. C'mon!
Off with the tops!
Get into it!
We'll take them off for the
march on, but not before!
Ohh. OK.
We'll wait for the march on.
But we still have to
do warm up.
Arm swings, c'mon!
Please leave the competition
area, to commence the march on.
and team presentations.
What was all that about?
Well, together with your music.
Let's just say, it's going to be
a very interesting day.
Welcome everyone to the deciding
competition for the
State Championships.
[Marching Music]
Teams competing today are--
Hub.
Aerial.
Dynamic.
Seacliff.
Elizabeth.
Saints.
And Coreega.
Gymnasts to your first
apparatus please.
These two seats free?
- Ah yeah, I think they are.
It looks like Maddy and Chelsea
are going to be the last
to compete on the floor.
The best I can work out is
whoever wins the floor
is gonna win the comp.
[Applause]
Wow! That's the highest score
for a level 6 on the floor!
That's gonna be hard to beat!
Oh no. This is not good.
- What's the matter, Shane?
Hold on a minute.
- Shane?!
Kate! Kate! Kate! Kate!
Maddy's base score won't
give her enough points
to beat Chelsea.
She needs a bonus skill.
What's the score difference?
She needs at least a .5 bonus.
There's not much we can do
about it now.
Do the layout backsault,
with a full twist.
That would give her
the extra point.
That's too hard for her,
Shane!
Chelsea can't even do that!
Kate? I want to do it.
I reckon I can.
I was so close last time.
And I am so much stronger now.
Maddy, are you sure?
You can do it, Maddy.
OK.
Maddy, Maddy.
GFG! GFG, Maddy!
GFG?
[Music]
Yes! Brilliant Maddy Brilliant!
[Audience cheer]
Is she equal with Chelsea?
- Yep!
It all comes down to Sally's
score now.
Here's Sally's.
[Clapping]
[Whispering]
What does that X mean?
I haven't seen that before?
It's some sort of error.
[Whispering]
Congratulations gymnasts.
Well done. Great competition.
Tom Johansson is here to do
the presentations. Tom?
Thank you. Get straight into
it shall we?
In 3rd place, actually we've got
two equal 3rd's today!
From Saints, Catherine Sims.
And from Coreega, Erin Bishop!
Well done girls.
[Applause]
And in overall 2nd place, plus
gold medal for beam and vault.
Chelsea Smith. [Applause]
Well done.
1st place, with the highest
score ever achieved for floor
in level 6, plus two gold
medals for floor and bar...
Maddy Cornell.
Well done, girls.
As promised,
the winner of today has
automatic inclusion
onto the national squad.
So congratulations Maddy
on winning that place.
Now I also announce that your
very own Sally Peterson
has been accepted onto the
international gymnastic
judging panel!
Well done, Sally.
[Whispers]
Your attention please.
Tom the chairman of national
selectors
has a very special
announcement. Tom?
Thank you. As I mentioned
before Maddy Cornell
has won her place
onto the squad. I also have
the discretion of adding
an extra gymnast
to the squad as well.
I'm pleased to announce with
an outstanding performance.
all year round.
We would like to add Chelsea
Smith to the squad as well.
[Applause]
- Congratulations, Chelsea!
And thank you everyone.
Chels. Chelsea! Chelsea!
Thank you judges, gymnasts,
parents and friends.
That concludes today's
competition.
[Applause]
They saw my 8 as a 3!
Oh dear!
Now girls, enough of this
between you two.
You're going to become team
mates and you're going to
behave like it,
or I'll make sure you're both
kicked off the team.
I don't think she has
the authority to do that.
You and I both know that.
But they don't.
I'm sorry for being mean to
you and Joshua and all that.
Sorry for being rude to you.
[Chuckles]
The national squad!
Both of us!
Hey kiddo.
Yeah, here she is. Give it up.
It was my fault.
- It was my fault.
No, it was mine.
- It was mine.
Kate, let me speak first.
I was the one that made up
that game on the beam.
And how we were pushing
each other off.
And I didn't even remember
until the other day that
my foot slipped.
I think it has just been easier
to blame somebody else
than myself and of course that
someone was gonna be you.
Oh, Sally.
- I'm sorry.
I won't be needing this.
Got my own.
Yeah!
My little champion!
C'mon girls, yeah!
Beautiful girls.
Keep going.
Keep the routine going.
Maddy's on the tele.
Come here you.
C'mon! Maddy's on the T.V!
We move to the final rotation.
I can see Maddy Cornell
just waiting to be introduced.
Representing Australia,
Maddy Cornell!
Maddy has an amazing story.
After her first regional
state championships
a short time ago,
she's now at the world
junior championships
and this performance
for the gold medal.
Maddy presents and takes up her
start position on the floor.
Unbelievable!
She started with a triple
twist and landed it!
No one will beat her now!"

What's that all about?
Oh! You're new here.
I've got a bit
of a reputation.
So, what are you?
A tough guy?
Oh, I don't think
anyone's ever
called me tough.
I'm Milo.
I'm Zack.
BOY: No, Zack.
(SOFTLY)
No, no, no, no.
So what exactly
is this reputation?
Well, people have used
the ""J"" word,
but you know what they say,
""Sticks and stones can damage
your vital organs
""so always wear body armor.""
(ARMOR THUDDING)
Hi, Milo.
Hi, Melissa.
I'm just gonna
stand back here.
Good call.
So, Milo, how was
your weekend?
Eventful.
Yeah, I'll bet.
I got a new scar.
Wanna see?
Sure.
Okay.
(CAMERA CLICKS)
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Oh, cool.
That's a good one.
I know, right?
All right, seriously, dude,
what's going on here?
What do you mean?
I mean, what is all of this?
And what is the ""J"" word?
(SOFTLY) Well, I don't
like to say it out loud.
(CRASHING)
Ah, it's one of those
heavy-duty bungees they use
to tie stuff down
in construction sites.
Hey, where did you get the...
(RUMBLING)
(SCREAMING)
I bet my pudding pack
we don't see them
again today.
I'll take that action.
Really?
Yeah, are you kidding?
Milo's tough.
As a matter of fact,
I'll see your pudding pack
and raise you
a snickerdoodle.
Or are you just all talk?
(CHUCKLES) She just
called you out!
Whoa.
(SCREAMS) Wait,
why aren't you screaming?
I find it doesn't help.
Just hurts the larynx.
Hand me that bungee
and you better hang on
to my backpack.
Wait.
(SCREAMS)
ZACK: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That bungee
was definitely defective.
(BARKING)
No, Diogee, go home.
Silly dog.
He's not supposed to be
in the street.
(SCREAMS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You might want to
slide over this way
a little.
(BOTH GRUNT)
The ""J"" word wouldn't happen
to be ""jinx"", would it?
Â¶ Look at that sun
Look at that sky
Â¶ Look at my sweater vest
I look so fly
Â¶ Look at that mailbox
Look at that tree
Â¶ It's about as beautiful
as it can be
Â¶ Whoa
Â¶ Today is gonna
be exceptional
Â¶ Never boring
even for a minute
Â¶ It's my world
and we're all livin' in it
Â¶ Whoa, whoa
Â¶ Never boring
even for a minute
Â¶ It's my world
and we're all livin' in it Â¶
(DIOGEE BARKS)
So, Melissa, what's up
with your boy?
I can almost taste
that snickerdoodle now.
Oh, yeah? You wanna
make it more interesting?
What are you guys
talking about?
Melissa's betting that
Milo's gonna make it
to school and on time.
I'm in.
What's happened so far?
Concrete drainage pipe
chased him down a hill.
I got some
vegan cheese sticks
that says we don't see them
till after lunch.
I got gummy licorice.
All right, all right.
Let me get my notepad.
No, no, no, no!
Wait, wait!
(GROANS)
Oh, man.
I'm gonna miss my first day
at a new school.
My parents are gonna
flip out.
Don't worry.
My dad always says,
""What doesn't kill you
only makes you late
for school.""
So I don't think
we're gonna miss
the whole day.
(BARKING)
No, Diogee, run home.
I'm going to school.
Plus, if we catch the bus
at the next stop,
we may not even be late.
I've got the bus route
marked on my GP... S.
It must have gotten wet
when we fell in the mud.
But fear not, I've got
a backup right here.
Paper map!
Old school.
(SCREECHING)
Huh. Oh, don't worry.
I remember the way.
This has happened before.
This has happened before?
This exact thing?
We'll beat them
to the next stop.
We just have to go
through the rock quarry.
Rock quarry, sure.
What could possibly go wrong?
Sorry, boys.
There's been a little
oil spill, as you can see.
It's been quite a mess,
so nobody's getting
through today.
I think we can still
make it across.
I brought galoshes.
I didn't.
I've got an extra pair
and they're hazmat rated
for a level 4 biohazard.
I don't think...
Here's a certificate
from the EPA.
What are you
a nine, nine and a half?
Well, it's notarized
so I suppose if you...

Maybe we should
go through the woods.
ALL: Whoa!
Look, they're safe!
They're cutting through
Coyote Woods.
Coyote Woods? What exactly
is your definition of safe?
Go, Milo!
So do you even know
where we are?
Oh, yeah. The fire's
dried out my phone.
We are right in the middle
of Coyote Woods.
Wait, Coyote Woods?
(WHIMPERS)
I've got a thing
about coyotes.
They're like big dogs
that are dangerous to pet.
Oh, don't worry.
There's no coyotes here.
There aren't?
No.
Actually, the woods were
named after actor
Peter Coyote.
Really?
Yeah. He donated
all this land to the city
as a wolf preserve.
(WOLF HOWLING)
You get how
that's not better, right?
(SCREAMING)
Don't worry.
Wolves love peanut butter.
(GROWLING)
(SCREAMS)
(BARKING)
Follow me.
(ALL BARKING)
You know, wolves barely
ever attack humans.
Is that true?
Oh, yeah.
Bees are responsible
for many more fatalities
than wolves every year.
(BEES BUZZING)
Hey! We're out
of the woods.
What do you mean?
We're outside the fence.
Just jump.
(HIVE THUDS)
Wow! That was
incredibly lucky.
The way the day's been going,
I was pretty sure
it was gonna...
(HOWLING)
(BEES BUZZING)
(GRUNTS)
(WOLF HOWLING)
(ZACK SCREAMS)
Are you guys seeing this?
Yeah, why is that wolf
wearing a turban?
Double or nothing.
Who's in?
How many fatalities
are blamed on wolves
and bees together?
Well, we would be
the first.
Whoa!
(WOLF HOWLING IN DISTANCE)
Here you go.
These will help us
navigate in the dark.
Dude, if and when
we get out of here,
I'm gonna have
to go my own way.
No offense. I just can't
handle all of this.
All of what?
(CHITTERING)
This cyclone of calamity
that follows you
everywhere you go.
How do you live like this?
How do you live
like that?
What do you mean?
I mean, you wanna live
like those other kids?
They took a bus to
school today. A bus!
Does that seem like
more fun to you?
Hmm, all right.
Where to next?
Well, there's a loose grate
up over here to the left.
I've been here before.
Of course you have.
All right, I guess
we turn the water back on.
You know,
we're missing one of
those heavy-duty bungees
that we tie
stuff down with?
And also a section
of one of that concrete
drainage pipe.
Huh? (GRUNTS)
(ZACK YELLING)
Hey, Milo,
is that a new scar?
Yeah, thanks for noticing.
Okay, Chelsea's in
for a pack of chips.
Sid's up to two
pudding packs.
I like that confidence, Sid,
but you're going down.
Mort's down for
cheese sticks and an apple,
and Bradley
is the big spender
with a whole
vacuum-sealed lunch pack,
which I can cover,
but I'll have to
bring it tomorrow.
(GASPS) Look!
There they are!
Oh, man. They're gonna
beat us to school.
Never mind, there they go.
Anyone wanna
up the ante?
I wish we had a way
to steer this thing to shore.
We don't need to. Look!
The Maple Street bridge!
Here, I'll give you
a boost.
(GROWLS)
(SCREAMS)
(DIOGEE BARKS)
(SIGHS)
(BARKS)
Excellent, Diogee.
Good boy. Here you go,
but I do need you
to go home, okay?
Go home.
He's not supposed to be
in the river.
(GASPS)
(SCREAMS)
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(CREAKING)
You know, I don't know if
it's the adrenaline talking,
but I'm starting to feel
like we can handle anything
that comes our way.
Well, maybe not anything.
Ninety seconds to the bell.
There is no way
he's making it.
(SCOFFS) If you're so sure,
it's not too late to sweeten
the pot.
Done. Three jawbreakers
and some vitamin C tablets.
What? It's cold
and flu season.
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)
(WHIRRING)
You know, they are
from out of town.
Maybe they don't even realize
they're inconveniencing us.
Uh, guys? Guys?
Um, I realize you've come
a long way,
but we really need
to get to school.
Well, Melissa,
start passing out the loot.
(BELL RINGING)
Phew! Made it all
in one piece.
Of course the wolves
got my lunch.
Mine got crushed
at the bus stop.
Guess we're going hungry.
Don't worry, I got
you two covered.
GIRL: Here you go.
BOY: Here you go.
Ooh, look!
A vitamin C tablet.
What? It's cold
and flu season.
Â¶ It's my world
and we're all livin' in it Â¶
The train to
the Museum of Natural History
should be here any...
Forty-one seconds.
Forty-one seconds
from now, apparently.
I'm really looking forward
to seeing some paleontology,
archeology...
All the ologies, really.
Milo, you're an ology
unto yourself.
Oh! Forgot my
student discount.
(BEEPS)
Thanks, Amanda.
Melissa, is there ever
a time you haven't
forgotten something?
Yeah, February 30th
or 31st... I forget.
Neither of those
are dates.
I'll be giving a tour for
anyone who's not going
to be at the ""Milo Show"".
Bradley, I don't have
a performance planned.
Sure, you say that now,
but then one geyser comes
through the floor,
and suddenly, Milo's
the center of attention.
Oops! I'm stuck.
Cue geyser.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Interesting tidbit about
the Museum of Natural History,
it was...
Shh! We're watching Milo
in the turnstile.
It's like he's on
Cirque du Subway.
(YELLS)
Should we wait
for the next one?
Nah, he's got it.
In three, two, one...
(YELLING)
This floor is a lot cleaner
than I expected.
MAN: (ON PA) Next stop,
the Museum of Natural History.
So, this is the subway?
You've never been on it?
It's dark and dirty
and full of weird smells.
That was their
ad campaign last year.
(WIND HOWLING IN DISTANCE)
Hey, you guys
ever hear about
those mole people?
(NERVOUSLY) No.
The urban legend?
A subspecies of
humanish creatures
roaming the tunnels
searching for prey.
Maybe we'll meet some.
Rather meet them aboveground.
Then they wouldn't be
mole people, they'd be...
People.
(THUDDING)
Does it usually do this?
Well, sometimes.
When the coupling's loose.
ZACK: The coupling's loose?
What does that even mean?
I better put on
my seat belt.
How's that going to work?
Easy, you insert the tab
into the buckle
until you hear a click.
Like this.
(BOTH GRUNT)
Oh, I get it now.
I would've had extras,
but you know,
the llama incident.
And so, that's when
the planetarium removed
Pluto from the cosmo show.
Man, Pluto has
to be a planet.
An astrologer told me
it's in my fourth house.
No, Pluto...
(THUDDING)
The other car came off!
Milo's in there.
Of course he is.
So, that's what a runaway
train car looks like.
I'll be honest,
I'm a little disappointed.
(ZACK YELLING)
(RUMBLING)
(SCREAMING)
Well, at least
we're aboveground.
(CHUCKLES)
(YELLING)
(ZACK AND MELISSA YELLING)
(BATS SCREECHING)
(BOTH SCREAMING)
MILO: And then to unbuckle it,
you press down this button.
(CLICKS)
(EXHALES)
Locked. How can these
be locked?
Does it usually do this?
(GRUNTS) The windows
don't open either.
What is the point
of a window
that doesn't open?
It provides work
for window washers
and glass installation
professionals.
And the ceiling.
Is there usually a ceiling?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Zack, are you
by chance claustro...
Not claustrophobic.
Just claustro-avoidant.
I avoid enclosed places
when possible.
Probably not possible
right now.
It's better
if I'm distracted.
Okay, wait.
Not helping.
How about this?
(ACCORDION PLAYING)
Now I'm distracted.
Have you been carrying
that the whole time?
I try to pack
for any eventuality.
Now let's see about
getting those doors open.
Ah, here we go.
Okay, next time,
key first,
tap dancing later.
This is amazing.
Look! A fossil!
Chicken wing.
Circa 1993.
See? Nothing can live
under here!
Not even chickens.
Could be worse.
How?
Mysterious underground
creatures?
I guess
that would be worse.
No, mysterious underground
creatures are coming
towards us.
Silver lining,
things can live down here.
MAN: Someone hit
the lights.
(CLICKS)
Well, I'll be honest.
I'm a little disappointed.
Young people
from the overland.
You shall be
our leaders!
No, no, we have a leader.
It's Dave.
'Sup?
It's a democratic
hierarchical society.
Wait a minute.
Who are you guys?
We live below.
The call us the ""Belownies.""
No, they don't, Scott.
We voted on this.
""Belownies"" sounds like
a lunch meat.
We're called
the Undergrounders.
I am the wise healer
among my peoples.
He is a pipe fitter.
Where are we?
We call our world
Subterranus.
(SOFTLY)
Terranus, terranus...
That one's true.
He just wanted it
so badly.
I wore them down.
So, where you kids headed?
Class trip to the museum.
I helped organize it.
He shall be our leader.
How long have you
been down here?
Since the before times.
Uh, about a month,
actually.
We were building
an extension on this line
but we got lost,
so we figured
we'd better establish
a new civilization.
Wow! You established
a new civilization
in a month?
You'd be surprised
how much you can
get done
when you're not
constantly setting up
and moving orange cones.
I shall be the leader!
Seriously, Scott.
So, you've got agriculture,
art, rudimentary government...
Licorice, somehow.
You're actually
going to eat that?
I'm trying to
distract myself from
the walls moving in on us.
I wonder what part of
the chicken is this?
The rat part.
Granola bars?
Oh. He bears
the sweet manna of
the overland!
Oh, no thanks.
I just had some ""chicken""
and kinda lost my appetite.
(SNIFFING)
Diogee? What are you
doing here?
Please be rescuing us.
The floppy-eared one
shall be our leader.
Weren't you allergic
to dogs?
Right, you know what?
Yeah, yeah, I actually am.
Wait, Diogee, our leader.
We are not starting
our own civilization.
They taste worse
than they smell.
Diogee always knows
the way home.
Diogee, go home!
(ALL CHEERING)
MAN: I enjoy running.
(GRUNTS)
(RUMBLING)
(BOTH YELLING)
No! Melissa! Milo!
ZACK: Are you guys okay?
Yeah, we're okay,
if you call being
buried alive okay.
I see light pass
this one rock.
Maybe if we can move...
(GRUNTS) No, no,
it won't budge.
Don't worry. I've got
my backpack right...
What was that?
Hmm. Well, okay,
maybe you can worry
a little bit.
(GASPS) Oh, dear.
13, 14, 15...
Oh! I could swear
we had 18 kids.
Can you read
my writing?
Is that a five or an eight?
Any minute now,
Milo is going to show up
and everybody is
going to be like,
""Oh, Milo, tell us
about your adventure.""
But until then,
I'm having my best day ever.
Mort, do you really need
more rose quartz?
If you understood
its properties,
you wouldn't
be asking me that.
Okay, here's the plan.
Someone crawl though
and jimmy out that rock
from the front.
I don't think
any of us can fit.
I can fit, I think.
But, Zack,
you're claustro-avoidant.
Are you sure
you wanna do this?
No, I'm sure I don't
wanna do it.
But you guys need me.
MAN: Good luck, kid.
SCOTT: It was nice
knowing you.
Hey, that was my flashlight.
MAN: Scott...
SCOTT: But he's gonna
use up the batteries.
Is there another flashlight
in there?
SCOTT: See?
My backup ""backup""
got crushed.
I can barely see.
Not much to see,
just kind of a tiny
enclosed suffocating...
You know what? Never mind.
You can do this.
Think of how you faced
down wolves and survived
an alien abduction.
And that's just
since we've met.
I'm sure you did
lots of stuff before that.
Nope, never did anything.
What if this rock is all
that's holding this up?
Don't worry. I'm sure
it'll all work out.
How do you know?
Because it has so far.
Relatively speaking.
Okay, on three.
One, two, three!
It's clear! Yeah!
Yeah!
See? I told you
it would hold.
Well, it held long enough.
You totally saved us.
He shall be our leader.
BOTH: Yeah,
he shall.
Thanks, guys.
I am impressed, kid.
I would've just let them
start a new society in there.
Hey, where's Diogee?
(BARKS)
ALL: Diogee!
(BARKS)
You know, we have no idea
where these tracks go.
I'm sure it'll all
work out.
You're sure?
He uses
that term loosely.
MILO: Uh-oh.
I got this.
Ooh.
Or not.
(ALL SCREAMING)
Oh, we survived.
Uh-oh.
Maybe not.
SCOTT: Oh, come on.
Yeah, I guess,
maybe if you squint,
it could be a five.
(STUDENTS EXCLAIMING)
Nope, it was an eight.
(CHUCKLES)
Milo, tell us about
your adventure.
And we're back.
What will you guys
do now?
There is no place
in your world for us now.
Then you can stay, Scott.
Me, I'm gonna go check
my DVR.
I've got a month of
the Doctor Zone Files
to catch up on.
Oh, that means
you missed it
when the trash...
No spoilers.
(ALL SAYING GOODBYE)
I shall return
to Subterranus.
(SOFTLY)
Terranus, terranus...
And you will be
my leader.
Oh, sorry, I'm trapped
in a rib cage right now.
Interesting tidbit,
stegosaurus ribs are...
Never mind.
(CACKLING)
He saw something in me.
Whatever he saw,
he also saw it in a dog.
(IMITATING SCOTT)
The floppy eared one
will be our leader.
(BARKS)
Â¶ We're all livin' in it
Â¶ Go, Milo
Go, Milo, go
Â¶ Oh, thanks, everybody
That is so motivational
Â¶ Go, Milo
Go, Milo, go

I know you skipped a grade in math,

That doesn't mean
you can sleep through my class.
I'm okay. I'm good. Really.
Then calculate the volume

Am I always gonna be known

Well, I mean, you did tell people
that a monster attacked you. Soâ¦
Yeah, when I was five.
You ate crayons when we were kids.
No one calls you Crayola Mouth.
That's because crayons are delicious.
Let's face it, monsters aren't real.

Big time Halloween party at mine tonight!
Costumes are not only allowed,
they're mandatory!

- Okay?
We should totally go to that party.
I don't know. Jesper is a senior.
We're only freshmen.
Kelly, it's Halloween.

Babysit for Ms. Zellman.

- The Ice Queen?
- Uh, yes, but don't... don't call her that.
No, thanks.
Well, my company Halloween party
is tonight,
and I overheard Ms. Zellman complaining
that she couldn't find a sitter,
so I thought...
Well, I thought you couldâ¦
So, you threw
my name out there to babysit?
Yes.
- Mom!
- Wellâ¦
- Dad! Mom sold me out to her boss!

- (KELLY SCOFFS)
- Thanks for havin' my back, Dad!

You know, I can barely

let alone take care of some kid.
Okay. Kelly, please.
(SIGHS) Now, if I cancel on Ms. Zellman,
she'll be furious.
(WHISPERS) This is the Ice Queen
we're talking about.
- But...
- Besides, it's only babysitting,
- and I thinkÂ it will beâ¦
- What...
- â¦really good for you. Plusâ¦
- But...
â¦you'll make 15 dollars an hour.
You can totally do this, sweetie!

""No ice cream, no gluten,
no caffeine, no dairy, no peanuts,
no more than 30 minutes of screen time""?
You have a stopwatch
on your cell phone, right?
- Iâ¦ I...
- Because it's Halloween,
Jacob may have three pieces of candy.
- Oh! I've got some...
- No, no, no, no.
Raisins, dried apple chips,
or puffed rice cakes.
Also, no running, no shouting,
no discussing global tragedies
or current events.
- Got it.
- Emergency contact numbers.
Poison control, his doctor, his dentist.
And his sleep time checklist.
Learn it.
It takes three hours
just to put him to sleep?
If he goes to sleep at all.
(SIGHS)
Jacob?
Jacobâ¦
This is your babysitter, Kelly.
(JINGLING)
Hi, Jacob.
Please don't go, Mommy.
- Halloween's scary.
- It'll be okay, honey. I promise.
Your muzzie-wuzzie loves you so much.
- This way, Kelly.

Hey! Spit that out!

Don't put me to bed! I can't go to sleep.
- Why not?
- I have bad nightmares.
Sometimes, at night,
that comes out of my fish tank.
It feels like it's coming to get me,
but Mom says it's just a nightmare.
I actually know a lot about nightmares.
- You do?
- Yeah.
And I get it.
Sometimes, they feel real.
Like, really real.
But it's just your mind
playing tricks on you.
They can't hurt you.
Mine can. I can make monsters.
There's no such thing as monsters.
But there isâ¦
Quackers the Duck!
âª Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo! Doo-doo-doo! âª

Whoa!
- What happened to Tedster?
- I dreamt he was on fire.
And when I woke up, he was.
(TEDSTER, SLOWLY) I want to hug you.
- I don't like his hugs.
- (SIGHS)
If it makes you feel any better,
when I was a little kid,
I thought my bad dreams
could come true too.
What did you do?
I grew up.
Now I'm just scared of real-life stuff,
like climate change,
and inequality, and talking to boys,
and, like, everything I read on Twitter.
It's really scary.
I'm not helping, am I?
(SIGHS) All right. Fine.
How aboutâ¦ I check under your bed?

I'm afraid of the dark.

This is serious. These were proper
creatures of the night, they... they...
Hello? Hello?
Who are you?
Liz Lerue. Babysitter.

These things came out
from under the bed.
They took him.
Look, I tried calling the police,
but they thought it was a prank.
- Hey! You can't go in there!
- What'd these things look like?
Um, they were small and fat,
with crazy teeth and weird hair.
- How many?
- Umâ¦ three.
- (GRUNTS) God!
- Height? Weight? Speech patterns?
What were they wearing?
Did they have eyes?
Um, they were two to three feet high.
Uh, claws.
They had weird mouths
and two eyes, lopsided.
This way!
They looked like this!
Toadies.
What's a ""Toadie""?
Also, whose baby is that?
Is it yours? I'm not judging if it is.
This is Carmella.
- Carmella, say hi. Don't be shy.

I'm babysitting her because
that's what actual babysitters do.
We watch and protect our kids.
Now, stand over there

She would never be late.

chew your hair, find out what you'd

(FOOTSTEPS GETTING FAINTER)

For real?
Wait, did you even see this?
- (WHIRRING)
- KELLY: These burn marks.
They come from out of Jacob's window,
run down here, and then they just vanish.
And those tracks.
They don't match the claws
that those trollies had...
LIZ: Toadies.
Toadies had.
And they have an entirely
different pattern and diameter,
which means
a completely different thing was here.

Are you talking to me?

- Will you knock it off?
No! Not you, just some girl.

If you give us the boy, you get sparkly.
- What do you say?
- (CHATTERS)
LIZ: Come on,
don't play hardball with me.
- You guys love to trade.
- (KELLY MUTTERING)
- LIZ: Jacob or sparkly?
- KELLY: Okay. Hello. Hi.
Do we have a deal?
(SCOFFS)
- (GROWLING)
- (GRUNTS)
- (PHONE PLAYING MUSIC)
- Okay. Damn.
Shut that off!
It's Jacob's mom!
Ms. Zellman?
Hi. How's the monster?
What?
Oh! You mean...
No. Yeah. Um... Everything's fine.
Jacob and I are having so much fun.
- (TOADIE GURGLING)
- What's that noise?
Uhâ¦ It'sâ¦ it's a movie.
That sounds like a scary movie.
Check the list, Kelly. No scary movies.
No, no, no, no, no!
It's... it's a fun movie.
- It's about unicorns and rainbows andâ¦
- (TOADIE CHATTERING AND GROWLING)
(RUNNING FOOTSTEPS)
- (LIZ YELLS)
- (ROARS)
What was that?
- KELLY: Umâ¦
- (CHITTERING)
- Aâ¦ unicorn fell off aâ¦ a rainbow.
- (TOADIE SQUEALING)
KELLY: But it was saved by a cloud.
We're all good here.
Let me speak to Jacob. Now!
Um, no, he's sleeping.
You said you were watching a movie.
- (CHITTERING)
- LIZ: Oh, no you're not! No!
No, he just...
He just fell asleep like that.
He did?
(LAUGHS) Oh. That's a first.
Tonight is a night of firsts.
WOMAN: The tenth annualcompany
costume party is about to begin!
(PARTYGOERS CHEERING)
MS. ZELLMAN:
I'm glad Jacob fell asleep early.
- (SQUEALING)
- Yeah. Me too.
Remember. Midnight.
- Okay. Bye. Bye.
- Sharp.
- Bye, bye, bye.

KELLY: I'm gonna be grounded
for all of eternity.
The Toadies left with Jacob.
So, how are we gonna get him back now?
That's why
this little creep's comin' with us.
- (CARMELLA COOS)
- It's nine o'clock, Carmella.
- We'll get you home, sweetie.

The Toadies always trade.
This is worse than I thought.

- (GASPS)
- (MAN SIGHS)
- (CROAKING)
- I wanna go home!
- You're not going anywhere.
Huh? Impressive, isn't it?
I suppose you want
to know how it all works.
(CHUCKLES)
I've slowly, but surely,
accumulated 51 rare gases
and mixed them
with the perfect specificity.
Why, you ask?
To fill these beautiful tanks
with enough power
to manifest my army of nightmares
into actual life!
Aah! Terrors alive like never seen before.
- (WIND WHISTLING)
- Aah!
All I needed was just
one more little tiny ingredient,
a pathetic
yet highly imaginative little twerp,
personified in this case byâ¦ wellâ¦
You, get it?
(WHIMPERS)
You, my dear boy,
will conjure an army
of infinite nightmares.
You and I are about to ruin the world.
Sleepy time.
âª Kids, I comeâ¦ âª
KELLY: Wow. We got the baby
back to her parents just in time.
I hope she wasn't too freaked out.
LIZ: Freaked out?
Carmella loves monster hunting.
âª Kids, I come for youâ¦ âª
How much did her parents pay
for you to look after Carmella?
Two hundo. Cash.
Is that the going rate these days
for using a baby as bait?
It was a good plan.
Ninety-nine percent of the time,
that should've worked.
And it's Halloween night.
What are you making?
Fifteen dollars an hour?
âª Kids, I come for you âª
(CHUCKLES) Yes.
Welcome to my Nightmare Nursery.
Your new home.
I trust you're snug as a bug?
(WHIMPERING)
Have you ever been hypnotized? It's grand.
JACOB: Hm? No! No!
- (WHIMPERING) No! Aah!
- Stop wriggling, you little worm.
My evil lullaby will put you
into a deep, dark sleep.
âª Do as you're told âª
- (CHOIR JOINS IN)
- âªWhat a gift, what a sight to behold âª
âª For the darkest of dreams âª
âª You'll surrender to sleep âª
âª Child, you'll do as you're told âª
Why are you singing?
- How peculiar.
- What?
That usually works.
Aah! Your Gift of Dreams
is blocking my lullaby.
Bravo, Jacob. Bravo.
Alas, fear not.
I have a few tricks up my sleeve.
You will sleep, boy.
Okay, wellâ¦
When my mom wants me to go to sleepâ¦
- Yes?
- She brings me aâ¦
Hyper Cola Energy drink.
- Right.
- And chocolate-covered espresso beans.
Then I'm out like a light.
Do you think I was born yesterday?
I'm not stupid, boy.
âª Bom, bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bomâ¦ âª
- (GIRL LAUGHING)
- BOY: Yeah, I know.
GIRL: Let me on your back!
âª This is a private jam âª
(LAUGHTER)
âª I see you walking with a hippie dance âª
(GROWLING)
âª Oh, your neon skirt danceâ¦ âª
You work for Brown University?
- Something like that.
- What's in the bag?
- âª Oh, no, no, noâ¦ âª
- My professor.
âª Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh âª
- âª You give me butterfliesâ¦ âª
- (BLEEP)
âª Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh âª
âª You feel like paradiseâ¦ âª

Welcome to the Rhode Island chapter
of the Order of the Babysitters.
We're part of a super secret organization
with chapters all around the world.
The Greek goddess, Artemis,
Cleopatra, Merlin,
Rosa Parks, all babysitters.
KELLY: Whoa.
Archimedes, Frida Kahlo,
Florence Nightingale,
Maria Tallchief, Noor Inayat Khan.
LIZ: Yeah. We've been around
for thousands of years.
Tell anyone about our location,
and I'll feed you
to our resident hobgoblin.
Listen up, SITs.
Our mission is Jacob Zellman.
Five years old,
possibly with the Gift of Dreams.
We have three hours and five minutes
until his mom gets back
and finds
her little bundle of joy missing.
(WHIRRING)
Nothing new from the surveillance cameras.
Hey, Berna, will you start the laser scan?
- On it.
- (BLEEP)
(WHIRRING)
GIRL: All right. Let's take a look
in this Toadie's pouch.
What the heck? Is that half a duck?
KELLY: It's a goose lamp.
- How big are their pouches?
- Who's the human?
This is Kelly.
GIRL: And why exactly is she here?
She was with the kid when he got taken.
- We need to pick her brain.
- But...
Just search the thing for clues.
Rude. It's not a ""thing.""
It's a Monstria Chordata Amphibia
Carnivora of the Toadie subspecies.
- (SIGHS) Remove her.
- Cassie, this isn't your call.
You're just a Sitter in Training.
I mean, see this? And this?
And this?
Chapter Vice President. Okay?
It's gonna take me hours
to remove the items from its pouch.
Better get to it, then.
- I'm so sorry. So sorry.
- LIZ: Follow me.
Hey. So, this Jacob kid
really has the Gift of Dreams?
I...
I just told her what Jacob told me.
I don't even really know
what the Gift of Dreams is.
It's... it's legendary.
A young kid who is supposed
to be able to bring dreams to life.
Or nightmares.
The Order was founded
to protect kids like that.
I could tell you a bit more
over a cup of coffee, maybe?
Pump the brakes, Casanova.
Can you make
one of your memory potions?
Uhâ¦ Yeah. I, uhâ¦
I have a passion for potions.
- KELLY: What is that?
- It's Minotaur Memory Dust.
Three parts beetle root,
one part gnome guano.
Yet, I have not tested this batch out yet,
so I hope I don't fry her brain.
Fry my brainâ¦
Now, tell us every single detail
you remember when Jacob was taken.
âª Do as, mm-mmm âª
âª Now give into the mm-mm-mmm âª
Maybe I used too much beetle root?
No, Iâ¦
I heard that song
when I was a little girlâ¦

MAN AND CHOIR:
âª You'll do as you're told âª
CHOIR: âª You'll do as you're told âª
CASSIE: Why did it stop
on the Grand Guignol?
BOY: He's the Stealer of Dreams,
the Bringer of Nightmares.
Legend has it
he's collecting bad dreams from kids
to build a nightmare army.
That's him.
LIZ: What do you mean?
That's the monster who tried
to take me when I was a little girl!
No. No way.
Liz, those prints I found.
They were tail marks, just like this.
I think he's what took Jacob.
This can't be happening. Not again.
- A-Are you okay?
- Well, you see, her...
BERNA:
It's not our story to tell, Curtis.
""The Grand Guignol travels
in the Nightmare Realm.
The Boogeypeople are almost impossible
to locate when they are in there.""
Boogeypeople?
Seven, actually.
They're like a monster mafia.
My whole life, my whole life
I was told this wasn't real.
That it didn't happen. But nowâ¦
- But nowâ¦
- This is why we don't let normies in here.
Each of us
has been through a monster attack.
This is from a Class Two Oozer.
CURTIS: Yeah, I've got one of those, too.
Fire-spitting Grunk.
- CURTIS: I was impaled by a Brush troll.
- BERNA: This is from a vampire rabbit.
- CASSIE: Krampus.
- BERNA: Thunderbird.
- CURTIS: Baba Yaga.
- CASSIE: Bunnicula. Paper cut.
- CURTIS: I got this from a Cloud Serpent.
- No one wants to see that, Curtis.
That's why we're here.
To make sure what happened to us
never happens to another kid.
- (STRAIGHTENS JACKET)
- (SIGHS)
So how do we take down the Grand Guignol?
We don't.
Well, there is a way.
It's a combination betweenâ¦
Angel Fire and Monster Punch.
Yet the ingredients are crazy combustible.
We're talking, uh, uhâ¦
cobalt from Athena's tomb,
umâ¦ Chupacabra venom...
- None of which we have.
- Don't worry.
- I have my sources.
- KELLY: And the Monster Punch?
That's the only way
to drive the Angel Fire
into the Boogeyman's heart.
It's crazy hard to execute,
even if you could get near him.
It's never been done.
There's a solution to every problem.
LIZ: All right.
Let's put that to the test.
Curtis, gather the essentials.
Yes! Time to geek out. Follow me!
Come on!
(BLEEPING)
(WHIRRING)
- CURTIS: Check this out.
- (BELL DINGS)
KELLY: A jump rope?
CURTIS:
No, it's not actually a jump rope.
It's a net made
from powerful Stiltskin Thread.
Pull the handle andâ¦ pshoom! (CHUCKLES)
(BELL DINGS)
This is the Mist of Hypnos.
One spray can knock
a lesser monster out cold.
CASSIE: Stop trying to impress her.
I am not!
(BELL DINGS)
And thisâ¦
Is the Booyah Bear.
Yank the ear and throw. Go ahead.
Check it out.
(TICKING)
- (TICKING SPEEDS UP)
- It's... it's not working.
- Throw it, Kelly!
- Okay!
Booyah!
(CURTIS LAUGHS)
Smoke diversion!
- LIZ: Don't waste the weapons, Curtis.
- (CURTIS SIGHS)
Let's go.
- Back to work, SITs.
- Wait, Kelly.
One more thing.
The Cairo chapter found this
in a tomb in Egypt.
We haven't figured out all it can do,
but we know it can break any hex or spell.
Here, take it. It might come in handy.
- LIZ: Kelly?
- Thanks.
If you're insisting on coming,
you can feed the Toadie.
- Wait, wait, wait. I don't know how to...
- LIZ: Open it.
(SNARLING)
Hm. (BELCHES LOUDLY)
(CHATTERS AND GROWLS)
KELLY: It's getting away!
- No, it's not.
- (PULSING WHIR)
Did you put a tracker in the trash?
Sure did. And now he'll scramble
back to the Grand Guignol.
Finally, we can locate a Boogeyman.
You wanted it to jump out at me.
You knew it would escape?
We are trying to rescue Jacob, Kelly.
Let's get monster-hunting.
(SCOFFS)
(SLURPS)
(BURPS AND SIGHS)
You've had your warm milk.
Twelve glasses of it.
Now go to sleep!

Hello?

(GRAND GUIGNOL) Gnome Street?
What are you doing there?
(BABBLES)
What? Babysitters? Tracking you?
Ugh. I hate babysitters.
- (BABBLES)
- You're mumbling again.
No one enunciates these days.
(BABBLES)
No, don't bring them here,
you smell-feast.
(BABBLES)
I have a dear friend
right around the corner from you.
Lead them there and inform himâ¦
Ah, the babysitter buffet
is officially open.
- (GASPS)
- (TOADIE CHUCKLING)
(BLEEPING)
The tracker says the Toadie's close by.
Take the right fork.
âª Yeah, ooh, la, la âª
âª By the pool we're singing ""Bailando"" â¦ âª
KELLY: It's the next driveway
on your right.
âª Keepin' those blinds closed, yeahâ¦ âª
- (CHEERING)
- âª She said I wanna find somebody âª
âª By nightfall âª
âª Ooh, la, la, could it be you, baby?
I like you âª
- âª Oh, watchin' her moveâ¦ âª
- Come on, baby! Yes!
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- What?
- This is Jesper Huang's party.
- Bunch of sweaty teenagers?
Place must smell like
a smorgasbord to a monster.
Come on.
Toadie's in there somewhere. Let's go.
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- What's wrong?
My crush is right there,
and I'm covered in dirt,
and smell like trash, and I wore
the exact same sweater to school today.
It's just a dude.
Victor Colleti is not ""just a dude.""
And Deanna's here. Great!
She looks amazing, of course.
(PHONE ALERT)
âª Won't leave me lonely tonightâ¦ âª
Great.
Liz, I can't go in there.
I'm having major anxiety.
What's wrong with you?
I mean, you're more scared ofÂ a mean girl
and some dude than a monster?
Fine. Yes, you're right.
Well, that girl you pointed to
looks far from amazing.
I mean, she's wearing a cat costume.
Since the dawn of time,
every basic girl
who has thought that she's hot
- has worn a cat costume.
- âª I was lost in the rhythmâ¦ âª
(SIGHS) And the guy, sure,
he's eye candy. I get it.
But that is not
what is important right now.
What we're doing is important.
You're obviously smart. Act like it.
Now move.
âª Kiss me like your ex is in the room âª
âª Don't you be afraid of somethin' new âª
âª If you play it right
You can be that someone âª
âª Yeah, that someone
Who won't leave me lonely tonightâ¦ âª

Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's... it's the worst.

âª Kiss me like your ex is in the roomâ¦ âª
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
Oh! Oh, my!
- Sorry.

Is that your... is that...
Is that your costume?
Yeah, I... I went as myself. Went meta.
Tried something different.
This way, Ferguson.
- KELLY: I have to... umâ¦
- Now!
Thanks for the drink.
âª Lost in the rhythmâ¦ âª

Don't be that girl. Come on, focus.

Don't come down here. Um, is there punch?
Let's get some punch. I'm thirsty.
- Are you thirsty?
- Am I?
- KELLY: Come on. Let's go.

(POP MUSIC PLAYING)
You brought your homework to the party?
Catching up with, uhâ¦ with... with bio.
You know, catching up, and extra credit.
Not that extra credit makes you a nerd...
Not that you're a nerd if you do extra...
My... What?
VICTOR: Uhâ¦ umâ¦
Uh, yeah.
Found you!
Oh. You're here, too. How anti-fabulous.
- You know this is a costume party, right?

(DEANNA SCOFFS)
Riiiight.
Yourself.
Do you like dancing?
'Cause you're gonna love it

There has gotta be something
we're not thinking of.
Berna, any nightmare pings?
- Negative, Liz.
- KELLY: Okay. That meansâ¦
That means Jacob's still awake,
which meansâ¦
The Grand Guignol can't get him to sleep.
So how does a Boogeyman
get a kid like Jacob to go to sleep?
- Curtis?
- Yeah, let me see what's local.
We have the Grit of the Sandman,
Somnolent Lotus Petal, orâ¦
Oh! Uh, uhâ¦ Cat's Eye Amulet.
Cat's Eye Amulet?

I was really hoping
you had some Icarus Wing.
(IN JAPANESE) An Icarus wing?
Are you serious?
(CURTIS, IN ENGLISH)
Please tell me that you do.
(IN JAPANESE) I'll see what I can do.

Let's get to work.
KELLY: So, what do I need
to know about this Cat Lady?
LIZ: She's an ex silent movie star
turned class five witch.
Last year, she and the Grand Guignol
teamed up
and almost destroyed
the whole babysitter chapter in Nepal.
And she once fed
an entire Girl Scout troop to her cats.
Here's the thing.
Iâ¦ I'm kind of allergic to cats.
KELLY: You're what?
LIZ: It's fine. It's the only way
we're gonna get back Kevin.
KELLY: You mean Jacob. Who's Kevin?
- Never mind.
- Liz.
(CAT YOWLS)
Tell me.
He's my brother.
The Grand Guignol took your brother?
I was six, Kevin was five.
It was midnight.
There was a scratch at the window.
I thought it was
a tree branch or the wind.
I jumped out of bed,
drew back the curtainsâ¦
And that's when I saw him.
He sang us a song,
and I fell under a spell.
When I came to, Kevin was gone.
I never saw my brother again.
I've been looking for him my whole life.
I mean, that's the reason
I became a babysitter.
Liz, Iâ¦
- I'm so sorry.
- Well, don't be.
- It... it wasn't your fault.
- No one believes that.
Not even me.
- (CAT YOWLS)
- (SCOFFS)
You have no idea what it's like.
To feel helpless? Out of control?
Like nobody believes you
but there's nothing you can do?
He came for me when I was a little kid,
and no one even listened.
But you know what changed things?
What?
Tonight.
You.
You did.
Okay.
Then let's do this.
We get in.
You distract Peggy.
I spray her. We grab the amulet. We split.
- Easy-peasy.
- (CHUCKLES)
- (CAT YOWLS)
- Let's just get this over with.
(CAT WAILING)
KELLY: Wait.
KELLY: So, how many cats does she have?
Ohâ¦
Just a few.
Here and there.
- (LAUGHS)
- (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS)
âª Proceed with caution âª
- âª You kiss too nicelyâ¦ âª
- What can I do for you ladies?
- Looking for a room?
- âª You might entice meâ¦ âª
- (LAUGHS)
- âª Travel at your own riskâ¦ âª
- (SNEEZES)
- PEGGY: Would you look at this?
Is that Liz Lerue?
LIZ: How do you know who I am?
Honey, please.
Monsters know Monster Hunters.
- Gotta know your enemies, right?
- (LIZ COUGHING)
- (COUGHING)
- Liz. Liz, Liz!
- Are you okay?
- PEGGY: Ohhâ¦
Not too great under pressure now,
are you, Liz?
- Where are the cats?
- I don't know.
- PEGGY: After allâ¦
- Sit down.
â¦you couldn't save
your brother from the Boogeyman.
(COUGHS AND GASPS)
Poor little Kevin.
- KELLY: You're gonna be okay.
- LIZ: Go spray her.
Try not to look at the amulet.
I'm glad you girls stopped by.
I love visitors.
Well, well, well. What do we have here?
PEGGY: Mercy me. The Grand Guignol.
What brings you to my neck of the woods?
(GRAND GUIGNOL) Your amulet.
You're a monster! (COUGHS)
And the sky is blue.
Tell me, do you have
any more brilliant observations,
- sister of the year?
- Where is he?
- Leave her alone!
- (LIZ COUGHING)
Who do we have here?
(SCOFFS) Scared little Kelly Ferguson.
Long time no see.
I bet you didn't think you'd see me again.
âª In the clutches of sleep âª
âª Listen, you'll do as you're told âª
(GRAND GUIGNOL WHISPERS) Nowâ¦
(THUNDER CRASHES)
(GRAND GUIGNOL) Come, child.
(HIGH-PITCHED WHIR)
(GROANS)
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
(GRAND GUIGNOL)
Did you really think you'd killed me?
That takes Angel Fire to the heart,
and I don't suppose you brought any.
- Whatever is the matter?
- Cat's got her tongue.
(SCOFFS) Huh.
Huh.
- Now, Peggy, if you please...
- If I give you thisâ¦
(GASPS)
â¦that makes up for Cat-mandu
and the cat-astrophe I caused there?
Absolutely, yes. And, as a bonus,
I'll let you keepâ¦ her.
Oh.
Very well.
This one, however, is mine.
- No!
- (CRACKLES)
(GRUNTS)
(LAUGHS)

KELLY: Berna? Curtis? Cassie?
Kelly! You're alive?
The Grand Guignol, heâ¦ he took Liz.
I couldn't get her back.
I lost them. I...
- I lost.
- Listen, Kelly.
- Just head back to HQ. I've got a plan.
- But what if Ms. Zellman comes home early?
Don't worry. I already hacked into
Ms. Zellman's phone and I'm tracking her.
(SIGHS) Liz found this
on the Toadie at the party.
Check it out.
(PHONE CHIMES)
Toadies love sparkly things, right?
Well, maybe this piece of glass
came from wherever he has Jacob?
I'll run it through the database.
(BLEEPING)
(WHIRRING)
I got a match on the glass.
It's from the Qeeqong lighthouse.
Yeah, but the Qeeqong Lighthouse
is condemned.
A perfect place for a Boogeyman to hide.
You're not going?
- Yeah.
- But, Kellyâ¦
What is that thing?
This is the coup de grÃ¢ce, my frenemy.
Tonight's been fun,Â butâ¦ nighty-night.

Oh, you should see your face.
Aah!

No, no, no, no.

Want to know a secret?

I'm not getting anything.
We need to get

But we don't have Angel Fire yet.
Or do we?
âª Aaah âª

- That's your only way out.
- BERNA: I got this.
CASSIE: The light
from this glowfish will hold it back.
Just go!
(MONSTER HISSING)
Ah! Liz, you're alive!
- Jacob's this way. Come with me.
- Wait. I thought he was in there.
- This way, Kelly.
- Where are we going?
- Come on, Kelly.
- Where are we going?
(GASPS)
Oh, no. He hypnotized you.
(BOTH GRUNT)
I don't wanna hurt you.
But I will. (GRUNTS)
(YELPS) Ow, ow ow!

CASSIE: Okay. Plan B.
Work with what you got.
I just need

- And then what? How do we catch a shadow?
- (HISSING)
The Einstein Dimension Box!

If we move together,
we can rope him into it!

Please, please, please, please.
Please, please, please, please.
Please, pleaseâ¦

Okay. Be brave.

You're gonna have to close the lid,

don't let him touch your hand.
Why? What happens
if he touches my hand, Cassie?
- What happens if he touches my hand?
- Just do it!
Yeah!
That is what happens when you break
into HQ and mess with my friends.
We caught it! No one's ever caught
a Shadow Monster before.
Yeah, we're legends!

(GRAND GUIGNOL) Oh, Liz!
Where are you, darling?
I need you
to deliver a message to my sister.
He still thinks you're under his spell.
(GRAND GUIGNOL) Have you met my sister,
Serena, The Spider Queen?
She thinks she's so cool and so evil,
just because
she's the Queen of the Boogeypeople
and I'm the baby brother. (SCOFFS)
Just a stupid little dreamer, am I, sis?
Just you wait.
Little brother will be in charge,
with my army of nightmares
waiting to rip humanity to shreds!
Hah!
How long have you been standing there?
Ah, whatever.
Did you lock your little friend up?
- Yes, Grand Guignol.
- (GRAND GUIGNOL) Marvelous.
We'll make
a fine monster-sitter out of you yet, Liz.
After tonight,
we'll be monstrously busy. Get it?
Grand Guignol,
there's a problem with the back tank.
If one of the Toadies has fallen in again,
I'm leaving them there.Â Come!
Aah! Yes, yes, yes!
(SIGHS) Good boy, Jacob. Good boy!
Nowâ¦
Aah!
What are you talking about?
It's working perfectly.
- My mistake, Grand Guignol.
- Yes, it was, you stupid child.
(SNIFFS)
(SIGHS)
Come down here, Kelly.
The stench of your fear gave you away.
Did you really think
you could sneak up on me?
Sneak up on the Boogeyman?
(CHUCKLES) I invented the sneak.
By the Order of the Babysitters,
I demand you give us Jacob.
By the Order of the Boogeyman,
you're a blithering idiot.
You're no hero.
You're just a weak, small,
pathetic, insignificant little girl.
- LIZ: Give him back!
- KELLY: No!
Oh! Nice try.
Berna, 70 degrees, 38 feet per second.
Just lob it!
Yeah. Nice arm, loser.
Who do you think you're dealing with?
I'm not the Tooth Fairy.
I'm the Grand Guignol.
Master of Menace, Sultan of Suffering,
King of the Monsters.
And you're babysitters.
I almost feel sorry for you.

It's okay, Jacob.
He's gone. You're safe! Okay?
- No! No!
- Hey, what's wrong?
Wait. Why are the nightmares still here?
It's okay.
You don't need to be afraid anymore.
Hey, listen.
Tell 'em to take a hike, kid.

Are you okay? Where are you?
- Is everything okay? He...
- Shhh!
Oh!
He's okay, you see?
Oh, I... (LAUGHS)

4,A Bad Son (1980) - full transcript,Bruno is released from prison. He looks for a job and tries to start a new life. His first stop is at his father's apartment.,"A BAD SON
Wait here.
We'll need your passport.
Passport.
Sit down.
Take his statement.
Name:
Bruno Calgagni.
Date of birth:
November 3, 1951
at Clichy sur Seine.
Address:
22 rue Vincent Garreau, Colombes.
Father's name?
Rene Calgagni.
Birth date and place?
In Arcueil.
I'm not sure of the date.
He's about 55...
Mother's name?
Jeanne Vernet.
Born June 19, 1931, at Rouen.
She died two years ago.
During your incarceration...
You left France to go to the U.S.
on December 11, 1974.
A year later,
you were arrested as a drug dealer.
Is that right?
You started using drugs here
and kept it up over there
but it's a costly habit
and you were broke.
So you became a pusher.
Is that right?
More or less.
You were arrested
on October 26, 1975
carrying 40 grams of pure heroin
you were peddling to students.
Sentence:
5 years of detention,
including one
in a Federal Disintoxication Center.
You were released yesterday.
Right.
Do you have a trade?
I was in a vocational school:
Woodwork.
Any money?
My jail earnings.
What's your address?
My father's place.
Does he know you're back?
No.
As soon as we check this out,
you're free to go.
May I go for coffee?
Bertrand, take him to the cafeteria.
Can I have one?
Sure.
The address you gave us
is no good.
Your father moved away,
but we've got his new address.
Here it is.
We'll give you clean slate
but Narcotics will keep you on file.
Coming!
May I?
Since when?
I got back this morning.
Let's make some coffee.
Where are the cups?
In the cabinet.
- Hungry?
- No thanks. I'm alright.
How long has it been?
Six years.
What time is it?
7:10 A.M.
- Shit!
- Are you late?
I start my crew working at 8.
The sugar...
You still take three?
- What's US time?
- One.
- 1 A.M.?
- Yes.
I've got to run...
Make yourself at home.
There's a bed-sofa.
We'll have to squeeze in.
There's food in the kitchen.
Take my keys.
The super has an extra set.
See you tonight.
Didn't you go out?
You must have been beat!
What time is it?
Get up!
Tonight, we're eating out.
My treat!
First, they put me in the kitchen...
because I'm French.
Next, I worked
in the plastics shop.
It was tough!
You can't stop:
Every move is clocked.
Why not woodwork?
There was none!
So what was the job?
Embossing.
At first,
you're too exhausted to think
which is just as well.
But once you get the rhythm,
it becomes automatic.
So when I wasn't working,
I kept on reading...
I read at night and on Sundays.
Not bad!
What about you?
Me? My job?
It's okay, I guess...
Lots of things have changed...
I mean they seem to
but in fact, they don't.
We vote for the same guys
and things go to pot.
We stand by like old dodos.
I hate to wind up that way!
I'm sorry to upset you,
but would you tell me about...
About your mother?
What do you want to know?
How she died?
Barbiturates!
It happened gradually.
She started when you left.
She quit her job.
She couldn't sleep.
She couldn't tell day from night.
So they gave her medication...
junk!
She kept on taking more of it.
I tried to stop her,
but she took it secretly.
So she had a heart attack.
It was Madeleine who found her.
She was lying in the doorway.
That's the story!
Need anything else?
Goodnight.
If you hear me, ignore it:
I get up early.
One more, please.
Have a drink.
No, thanks.
Come on: It's on me!
No, I'd rather not.
Come on. Give the man a drink.
I said no and I mean it.
Leave me alone!
You coming down?
Yes, I've got to report...
and I'll scout around for work.
So, you're back?
Since Wednesday.
I was nearby, so I figured:
""I'll go see Madeleine.""
How about a kiss?
I'll be right with you.
Wait in there.
- May I?
- Yes.
Take over the counter for awhile.
We didn't expect you back.
Well, here I am.
You've changed.
You haven't.
Living at home?
Yes.
How's it going?
We're alright...
I mean I think so...
I'm not really sure.
Did he tell you about her?
Yes...
That's just it.
You saw her often?
Yes...
I tried to make her go out,
do things, talk...
but she wouldn't listen.
Why did you stop writing her?
I had nothing to say.
It was always the same letter.
""S.T."" What does that mean?
Skilled technician...
Not for you!
You'll have to aim lower.
Don't worry, I can take it:
My morale is sky-high.
If they hadn't arrested you in time,
you'd be a professional drug dealer
by now...
A corruptor!
A social cancer!
You bet!
At least, I wouldn't be job-hunting.
We'd be loaded.
We'd own big hotels,
bank accounts,
a yacht.
We'd sail around the world.
You'd be the captain
and I'd be at the helm.
You'd shout:
""Head for Bermuda, son!""
Going out?
I want some fresh air.
Do you mind?
You need cash?
I'm O.K.
Truck No. 3: You... you...
You two on No. 4!
You back there and you two,
go with Chauchard.
Not you...
it's a man-sized job!
Are you French?
OK, but you sweat
like the others!
You, wait here.
You guys on No. 6.
Okay, let's go!
Come on.
- You okay?
- Sure...
You've got balls...
Most Frenchmen quit after 3 days.
Where were you before?
In jail.
Calgagni.
- What's up?
- I came to see you.
So long, boss.
Take care. Watch your step!
Let's not stand here.
I'm thirsty. Come on.
It's on me!
So you're rich?
He just got paid.
What does he do?
Ask him.
I'm in trucking.
D'you drive?
No, I load.
That's a tough grind.
If you'd listened to me...
I've listened for 30 years...
and so what?
Let's kill the bottle.
Go easy:
He won't make it up his stairs.
If I'd told Fran?oise,
I'd ask you up for dinner.
- It's on me.
- Look at him...
He thinks I'm drunk...
I never get drunk.
It's time to go...
I'll leave you the car.
Pick me up tomorrow.
Take care, kid.
Don't worry about me.
I'll outlive you.
I'll miss him.
Is he quitting?
No, he's retiring next year.
What time, tomorrow?
Same time.
You always said Friday
was a good day.
Sure, it used to be pay day...
The foreman would bring us
the envelopes.
We could feel the bills inside.
At the time,
it seemed a lot of dough.
What are you looking at?
Those two.
What about them?
They look good.
Maybe so...
but I'm too old for that stuff.
You're kidding...
you mean to say that...
I mean it's none of your business.
Anyway, it's good to sit
and talk together.
I feel great!
I got paid today...
I want to chip in.
Into what?
The household expenses.
There's no need to.
Even so, I want to...
Drop it.
Wait here.
They're part-time hookers.
They'll give us a cut rate
because we're two.
Let's ask them over.
- Sit down.
- Sure.
You're Bruno.
What's your buddy's name?
Ren?.
I'm Marina...
Tell them your name.
Sylvie.
She's not talkative.
Can I have one?
Help yourself.
What will you have?
We were drinking tomato juice.
You work around here?
No, no...
We're...
You're what?
So now, you're pimping?
You little punk!
What did I do?
Tell me!
Beat it!
Are you drunk? What's wrong?
You idiot! Don't you realize
she died on account of you?
You killed her!
You ruin my life and now
you treat me to a cut-rate screw!
I'd rather jerk off!
Get away from me...
I can't stand the sight of you!
This is for you.
It's from Mental Hygiene.
So long.
Bruno...
When did they release you?
A month ago.
Since then, have you been tempted
to resume the habit?
No.
Any sexual relations?
Yes.
For cash!
Must you ask?
Let me explain our function:
You report here
for control consultations.
We're Mental Hygiene,
not policemen.
If you fail to report,
I must notify the Narcotics Bureau.
We're here to help you.
How?
My problem's the same
as everybody's: It's money!
I got a job
and lost it two weeks later.
My problem's lack of work.
We're not an employment agency
but we can try to help you out
by finding something in your line.
Cabinet-making, carpentry...
- Didn't we have something?
- Not anymore.
What about Dussart?
It's not your line of work...
It's a bookshop.
What do you think?
Why not? I'll try it.
I should warn you
that one of his employees...
How long has she been there?
Six months.
She's in post-rehabilitation.
Do you mind?
Not at all.
Call Dussart right away.
He's a nice guy. You'll see.
Can I see M. Dussart?
- What for?
- For a job.
I'm Bruno Calgagni.
I was sent here by...
I suppose you know already.
Yes, I do.
M. Dussart isn't in just now.
May I wait?
If you like.
Old editions?
Yes.
Can I help in any way?
Frankly, I'm no intellectual...
We don't deal in comic books!
Catherine,
I found the new version. Look!
It's your third!
But this is the best one.
The duet in the first act
is superb...
M. Calgagni is waiting for you.
Bruno Calgagni!
What a pleasure to meet you...
Your name:
you're related to Galiani,
Mme d'Epinay's lover
who wrote ""Dialogue on Women?""
Rather raunchy but first-rate.
By the way, Catherine,
see if Degref's got
the ""Dialogue of Courtesans.""
Right now?
Yes, the customer wants it today.
I assume you know
we need someone
to handle the orders
and catalogue shipments.
But first,
there's the inventory.
Let me show you.
It's temporary work,
but there's so much
to be done that...
As you see, it's a big job.
Catherine insists
we put it all in order.
She's too logical to see
that this apparent mess...
This pig-sty...
reflects my concept of order.
But it doesn't look orderly.
She prefers visible order.
Look, I'll show you.
Name a title... any title...
""Red and Black""...
Fine! Which edition?
1854?
I'll close my eyes.
Here it is. Check it.
You're right!
There!
When can you start?
Right now.
You can't do the inventory yet.
Catherine, what do we start him on?
The orders.
The lists are on my desk.
It's simple:
The books are classified...
by genre and by author's names.
I'm furious:
A 3-hour wait for two side-seats!
- Below?
- No, thank God!
Carlos, this is Bruno.
He's helping us.
Look!
- You got it?
- Yes.
Solti's better.
You haven't even heard it...
I have!
You heard it, but did you listen?
- And these?
- I couldn't find them.
I was waiting for you.
They're not in the ""L's.""
It's a pen-name. Look in the ""D's.""
This is where she excels...
it's magnificent.
But Caballe's better
in the low tones...
In the low tones, maybe...
but even so...
Most of them just use their throats
and vocal chords.
But Freni sings with her body,
with a full range of emotions...
This is Opera!
What do you think?
No comment...
I'm not myself today.
I see...
Don't let us spoil your meal.
No, on the contrary...
I enjoy listening to you.
Things shaping up?
Yes, in fact, I'm in advance.
You're a quick learner.
I guess so... I'm fairly handy.
When you're ready,
we'll do the inventory.
I'll get her.
Catherine, it's Robert.
What can I say?
No, I don't think so.
I told you... I don't know.
What about the inventory?
Alright.
We'll start with the stockroom.
Where do these go?
On the table.
Get up there.
Pull all names that don't start
with an ""A.""
Amyot... Apollinaire... Carco...
What's that one?
Verlaine.
Damn it!
No... Let me...
I'll do it.
Why did you choose this job?
I didn't.
We were both sent here
by the same agency.
I've been here for 6 months.
I like it.
I won't last that long...
Why not?
Dussart likes you.
I like him too...
but the problem is you and me.
It's my fault.
I don't mean to be hostile...
Yet you are.
No.
Besides, that's no reason to quit.
Yes, it is...
Ever since I'm here...
something's happened to me...
that hadn't happened...
for a long time.
I want to hold you in my arms...
to touch you.
I'm in love with you.
I know it's hopeless
but I had to tell you.
It's not hopeless.
I couldn't help it.
It doesn't matter.
I'll try to do better next time.
I'll make us some tea with rum.
It's freezing in here.
Isn't it heated?
No.
It's a big pad.
It's huge.
It's not my pad.
Whose is it?
Nobody's.
My father owns it.
Sit down.
He's got 3 or 4 more like it.
What does he need them for?
To make a living.
He used to be rich.
He invested and lost all his money.
So now, he wheels and deals.
He buys old flats,
renovates and sells them.
This one's been empty for a year.
He can't afford to fix it up,
so I live here.
Alone?
Yes.
What about that guy who calls you?
Robert?
He meant a lot to me at one time.
But now...
it's over.
And...
And what?
Never mind.
You want to know
if I still shoot up?
No.
Yes, I still do...
at times.
Any more rooms?
Yes.
Can I look?
You buying?
Sure.
This was the library.
It's nice. There's a carpet.
No light?
There's no bulb.
It's nice here, in the dark.
You haven't seen him since?
No.
Do you mind?
Yes.
We're late.
Isn't he more unhappy than you?
Maybe so... I don't know.
Don't forget that auction in London.
I won't.
You should leave on Saturday,
see MacMillan on Sunday
and stay over till Tuesday.
I'll do that.
I'd like to look at this.
So, you're living with Catherine?
Yes.
- Do you mind?
- No, not at all...
On the contrary!
I wasn't expecting you.
I meant to tell you, but...
You don't have to.
We each lead our life.
Each one lives...
as he likes...
as best he can.
Did you eat?
No.
I needed her...
It's your own business.
Now, you know about us.
I'm glad of it.
- How are you?
- I'm making out.
Working?
Yes, in a bookshop...
It's cultural.
Does it pay?
Not enough to be taxable,
but I get by.
Your father and I,
we've been together
for a long time.
How long?
In those circumstances,
it was natural:
You... plus your mother
who'd lost her will to live...
But I loved him before!
Why not?
We've nothing to be ashamed of!
But you did it on the sly!
What does that mean?
What are you insinuating?
You told me I killed her...
that she died
because I left.
- Yes, you left.
- So did you!
What gives you the right
to speak to me this way?
Who asked you to come back?
Pardon me!
Bruno, don't leave like that.
Let go! You're both bastards!
Take that back.
Take it back right now!
You old phony!
My brother! How are you?
They're friends.
Come on.
Where have you been?
Still interested in woodwork?
I know of a job.
I've got one,
but tell me about it.
It's with a cabinet-maker.
I work there.
The boss is looking
for a carpenter.
He's a good guy,
not one of those racists.
He handles cabinet-work,
but his specialty is chairs.
We'll start you on joining.
If you're good,
we'll put you on molding.
By next year,
you'll be a qualified cabinet-maker.
What did Dussart say?
Nothing. He shed a few tears,
but he understands.
Anyway, the only problem is us...
I mean you.
Do you mind?
No, I'm glad for you.
I wanted to ask your advice,
but they wouldn't wait.
So, where is that chapel of yours?
You're some guide!
You should have turned right.
I would have,
if you'd warned me in time.
One says: ""We turn right
at the next crossing.""
That way,
I can slow down and turn.
I did warn you!
Dussart, you're a pain in the ass!
Let's just skip the chapel.
Which road do I take?
I can't tell by this map.
I think I'll turn left.
Wait... I know where we are!
He knows!
I used to come here in summer...
in a house nearby.
I rode my first bike here.
I broke my arm.
Anyway, the sea's over there.
What do I do?
Let's head for the sea.
We thought you'd forgotten us.
No.
Aside from the kitchen,
nothing's changed.
In summer, with all the kids,
we're crowded
but for us two, it's fine.
And you come here...
All year long:
Winter and summer.
How long has it been?
Forty years.
Remember the table?
A labor of love:
No nails, only dowels...
real craftsmanship.
His father made it. He slaved over
the drawers and swivels.
He hated the seashore...
but he came here every Sunday.
He kept on perfecting it.
That's when you came here.
What's he doing? He's crazy!
He can't do that!
Why not?
The water's ice-cold.
He could catch a...
I feel just great.
You should have joined me.
I'm so hot, I'm in a sweat.
What's wrong?
Are you cold?
It's not that...
No... I want to walk by myself.
Pay the check. We're going home.
You know,
she's not completely cured.
She tries to cope,
but at times,
when it's too painful,
it's best to help her... to keep her
from shooting up in secret.
You know what I mean?
Yes, I do.
What's that?
I'm working.
Dussart wants to publish a book
on Paul Klee.
I've got to find the texts
and choose the reproductions...
it's a job.
I've been at it since noon.
- Tired?
- No.
Look what I found:
""At the age of 29, I'm losing
my belief in unhappiness...""
- Hungry?
- A little. What about you?
Not yet. I ate at 7.
Do you mind?
I'd like some wine.
You know, they came back...
the two brothers
who want to buy my shop.
No, I didn't know...
but don't ask me for advice!
That's fine.
I wasn't planning to.
Let me out here.
Take this.
What do we do?
Why ask? The rain's stopped.
Are you sure?
No, I'm not sure.
I'm not God. Let's go!
Come on...
Bring the slings
and that drag...
Are you hurt?
I don't know...
I gave him a sedative.
We'll take some rays.
He didn't say a word...
he didn't even complain...
so we had no way of knowing...
it was serious.
Then, they examined the rays.
It was a broken hip.
For a younger man,
it's not serious.
But he's middle-aged...
and so are his bones.
So, they operated...
If things go well,
he'll start re-education.
But it'll take time.
When did it happen?
Three weeks ago.
Why didn't you tell me?
He wouldn't let us.
Between you two,
I just don't know...
What about the hospital?
Don't they notify the family?
I'm his family!
Sure...
but he crossed it out.
Crossed what out?
Your name.
I see.
What will you do?
Nothing.
Won't you try...
No, I won't go there.
Excuse me, can I speak with Bruno?
Yesterday neither?
No, thanks. I'll call back.
I insist. You earned it.
Where is she?
She's asleep.
Why don't you jump out?
It's quicker!
Don't talk to me like that.
I've been clean for 5 years.
I don't need it anymore
so it's not that.
But I've got problems.
I wanted an out... just once.
What about her?
An out!
The only way out
is through the window.
Out of what?
Yourself, the world, solitude, fear?
You go for a walk
and you're out!
Out where?
Look:
it's 9 A.M.
and I'm 63 years-old...
I'm cold, I'm a homosexual
and I'm debt-ridden.
I can't afford my life style,
my shop, Carlos and Catherine.
So I drink one or two cognacs...
the whole bottle.
Why drink? The old fool's got
his books, his records...
Yes, but he wants out!
So long, friends. I'm off.
When will I come back?
When I'm sober:
My house is in order
and I'm 30 again:
No Bruno, or Catherine
to worry me.
I own the bookshop.
Everybody's a homosexual...
or else, they're persecuted.
Carlos will be a liberal
instead of an idiot!
Yes, it would be great
to get out...
If only we were sure
we can come back.
Dussart, take me away.
I've got to go back there...
and finish my cure.
Are we set?
- Where are the clamps?
- In front.
Okay, let's get going.
We can't go on this way...
If the labor inspectors find out,
they'll kill me.
So far, you're not on my books...
but from now on,
it will be impossible.
- Problem?
- It certainly is.
The fact is...
I hate to let you go.
So would I.
But if I take you
on a regular employee,
I've got new parameters.
You know what I mean?
Parameters? Christ!
Anyway, I've decided to...
To keep me and declare me!
Right!
That calls for a drink.
Some hideaway!
I've been turning around
in circles for an hour.
I've been doing that
for a whole month.
After the treatment,
I didn't feel like staying on...
The usual convalescent syndrome.
But I'm hanging on.
How am I?
Very beautiful.
Since he moved to a hotel,
we've been out of touch.
He knew we weren't supposed
to meet...
or call each other.
But at first,
he sent me letters.
He wrote about me,
not about himself.
He wanted progress reports.
But he hasn't answered
my last two letters.
He knows he can call me now.
Frankly, I don't really know him,
but that doesn't mean...
I don't like him.
I know.
How can I thank you?
I'm so pleased...
I warn you:
Proofreading is painstaking work.
As for my notations,
you can use your own judgement.
Did you hire a new man?
No, I make do with Carlos...
Though he insists
on prestigious work only.
If I send him to the stockroom,
his lordship is offended.
He glares at me as if to say:
""Why me? Why not him?""
What do you want?
I'd like some news.
Of your father?
I have none...
Not any more.
He kicked me out.
Didn't you know?
How could I?
He won't see anyone,
not even Andr?.
He holed up by himself.
The super brings him food.
He's a real beast!
With him, you've got to hang on...
so I did.
I hung on for a long time.
But now, I can't anymore.
Are you expecting someone?
It's alright. I'm early.
I'm 47 years-old.
I've still got time
but I can't waste it.
I want to live a full life.
There are other men...
who love life... who take chances.
With your father,
I didn't have a chance.
I loved him,
but he withdrew.
He set up a tough carapace
between himself
and the whole world.
Yet, I truly loved him...
as I loved you.
But you're both alike...
I can't do anything about it.
There's a woman between you two
and I can't help that either.
I've got to take care of myself.
I said I'm 47. Well, I'm 49!
I've got to race against time
and not confuse speed with haste.
Well, well... here you are.
Not working today?
This is Sunday.
That's right.
Wait... I was just going to...
Go on. Don't mind me.
I'll be alright...
it's a little complicated.
You have my key?
So much for re-education!
Still, I manage
more or less, as you see.
But my working days are over.
Have a seat.
Don't you ever go out?
You can use the elevator...
get some fresh air.
What d'you do all day?
Read... listen to the radio...
Watch TV.
The super drops in sometimes
and the two of you
re-shape the world.
Why won't you see Madeleine?
I don't feel like it...
She thinks she's obliged to...
And that perfume of hers...
I can't stand it!
You could ask her
to change brands...
You want a drink?
Empty...
There's another bottle in there...
Take a look.
Bring yourself a glass.
It's empty too.
Shit!
I'll get some.
Need anything else?
Cigarettes.
And some coffee.
May I speak with Catherine...
Catherine Segal?
D'you know when she'll be back?
Just tell her I called...
Bruno Calgagni.
Yes... Bruno.
It's not important...
Wait, yes it is!
No, I'll call back.

5,A Bag of Marbles (1975) - full transcript,Two young French Jewish boys and their family struggle to survive the WWII and the invasion of Germans.,"Â¤ A BAG OF MARBLES Â¤
When Dad was forced to put this sign in the window:
""Jewish Establishment"" in German,...
Maurice and I were mad.
We could never get used to it.
And when the Germans came by,...
we'd stand in front of the poster to hide it.
The Germans were already rounding up the Jews.
No one was safe.
""Modern Barber.""
Take a break, go have some fun.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
It was the first time a German had come into the salon.
~ Gentlemen.
~ Good morning, sir.
Haircut, please. A haircut, please.
Papa didn't quite understand since there was an edict...
prohibiting entry to local Jewish businesses.
Soon the entire neighborhood was laughing,
saying that Dad was now a barber to the Wehrmacht.
Look over here.
Hey, is that your brother?
He looks nice.
Try to smile, OK? Smile.
I'll show you something.
Tell those two kids not to stand there.
Take a hike.
""Jewish Establishment.""
~ Lieutenant!
~ What?
~ This place is Jewish.
~ What? Really?
Yes, there's a placard that we missed.
The two kids were blocking the notice.
We're all Jews here.
~ They're just kids.
~ You should have told me.
Well, you know now...please.
They're teenagers. Come on.
Excuse me, sir.
My kids are busybodies...there's always something!
The next morning they raided the barber shop...
but only arrested a Jewish stranger who had wandered by.
Next.
~ Good morning.
~ Good morning.
Please.
~ It's for the star.
~ Just a moment.
~ And these are my children.
~ Thanks.
~ Take the two cards.
~ Quiet down.
It wasn't me, it's him.
Hey, buddy.
They wrote ""Jew"" in red in our documentation...
and then we were are forced to wear a star.
Later on, we had an 8 PM curfew.
My brothers wanted to flee to the Free Zone,...
because the Germans had not then occupied the south of France.
There life could continue...
Next.
as usual for Jews.
If you give in on this, what will happen tomorrow?
Are you ashamed to wear that star?
No --- I thinking about what German Jews have said.
Don't worry.
Papa, you'll see tomorrow.
Come with us and forget the hair salon.
~ We're staying here.
~ Dad.
~ Henri, listen...
~ Dad.
~ The salon ...
~ I hate this star.
Please sit down and shut up for a bit.
We live in the hair salon.
We'll manage. You can find work.
Remember how they said German Jews had their homes confiscated?
Sure.
In France the same thing will happen.
There are still good Frenchmen in France.
You know you should leave.
French Jews or foreign, there's no future here.
We understand, we know what they do. We must leave.
But it is dangerous to cross the border into Free Zone.
Here you're at much greater risk!
People are betrayed and caught.
Many manage to make it through.
Here there are checks and raids.
You know there is no other solution.
~ You ARE ashamed of that star.
~ That has nothing to do with it.
~ We must leave.
~ If you have no other option,...
I ask you to go with dignity.
~ And with your head held high.
~ When can we go?
Well, until you leave we'll still go for walks together.
OK?
Kids in front.
Come on, baby. Move.
Come on.
Where are we going, Dad?
You can go for a ride to Barbados.
How are you, Aaron?
Shit!
The pigs have arrived.
~ Jewish!
~ Hey, Jew.
Have you seen his nose?
What's with my nose? It's like it was yesterday.
~ No, it's changed.
~ You started the war, Jew.
We are at war because of the Jews.
It's your fault, Jew.
~ Hey, Jew.
~ I'm sick of Jews.
You should be kicked out of school!
~ What've you got against him?
~ Down with the Jews!
Down! Down!
Pound him good!
What happens outside of school,...
I don't know or care.
But some of you this morning...
with a certain distinctive look,
do not think we can forget
the usual discipline.
What I saw in the yard was out of order.
That will not happen again.
To this end, some things will not be changing much.
Zerrati, what do I hope to hear?
~ The flight of a fly.
~ Do you think that I can't hear
while you chat with your neighbor?
~ No, sir.
~ So?
When I say, and only then,...
ClÃ©ment will replace Toledano,...
who will change with Joffo and Tounessus,...
and Blondo will switch with Gottlieb.
Move --- and in silence.
Usually it was good to be at the back of the class,...
but I did not like this.
Besides, Gottlieb was my neighbor and was no prize.
ClÃ©ment, tell us what tenses can be used...
with the conjunction ""so"".
~ No one knows?
~ Sir!
The only ones which can be used with the conjunction...
since no one will answer...
are the past and the future perfect in
the indicative mood.
Joffo.
That I did not like.
I didn't mind the ruler.
Knees were not what hurt most.
You wouldn't say that if it was your punishment.
Your turn.
What? I see you're not wearing a star.
It's like, I couldn't stand it. Besides, I'm Italian.
Maybe someday I'll have to wear one, too.
There's no danger. Italians and Germans are allies.
So what have you decided?
Tell me what would you'd do with it.
Hey, weren't you given one?
Yeah, I was given one.
Tell me what you want to do with it.
It's for my collection, I think it's neat.
Yes!
You're a bit silly. Who collects stars?
If you're a collector, you can collect anything,...
even badges.
All right. Don't trade it for the marbles,...
but say that's what happened.
No marbles, and I keep it.
No. We say that it's for marbles,...
even though I've got almost 2,000 at home.
What are 100 marbles, more or less?
After all, you don't face a beating with a stick at home.
Okay, I'll swap it, but only when no one's looking.
No one, come on.
It's not perfect, huh?
""Jewish.""
~ Do not worry.
~ You ripped my coverall!
Yes!
~ You ripped my coverall!
~ It's the business deal of the year.
Well, does that lift a weight off your shoulders?
I made a good trade despite the beating they gave me.
Well, goodbye.
~ How pretty!
~ See you.
But for me school was over.
My brothers had crossed the border.
Now it was our turn.
What we liked best was traveling alone,...
especially Maurice.
You know, Maurice?
I'm tired of being Jewish.
You, tired --- why?
Aren't you proud to be Jewish? Would you rather be a Catholic?
No, but I wonder what I have done to the good God
that he made us Jews. It's not a matter of pride.
Oh, yes.
Today, it's not a question of pride.
Yes, because...
I don't get it. It seems that you want to become Catholic.
~ Maurice...
~ Do you want to become a Catholic?
What counts now is not appearing to be Jewish.
Don't you understand?
Joseph, come here.
Come on, baby.
Tell me, Joseph: You know that this trip...
will be a test?
Yes, but...
according to our brothers' letter, everything will be fine.
~ Do you think you stand firm?
~ Yes, Dad.
~ Tell me, Joseph, are you Jewish?
~ Yes, Papa.
~ Are you Jewish?
~ No, I'm not Jewish.
Our survival depends that question! Have you got that?
Tell me:...
Do you understand what it means?
~ Yes, Dad.
~ Very well, my boy.
Both of you must take your chance.
Don't even go near a synagogue.
Gentiles can't see that you are Jewish.
~ Aside from my blue eyes.
~ Yes, in your case it's debatable.
I salute you for your blue eyes.
Do you know that I, too,...
I had to leave Russia when I was seven years old?
Yes, I remember.
You've told us.
~ Do you remember?
~ Yes.
I hope everything goes well.
Yes, anyway...
As Joe said,...
no news is good news.
~ So, will it be?
~ Follow his path.
But you are aware that is very serious,...
crossing the Free Zone frontier.
Don't you trust us?
I never said that.
I simply say that
is not a trivial matter.
It's very serious.
Well, little one.
~ I hope you are brave.
~ Of course.
See you soon.
~ Good luck, Son.
~ Bye, Dad.
~ Take care of yourself, Papa.
~ Good luck, boys.
~ Come here, Joseph.
~ Yes?
Come, my boy.
Do not let your brother swipe a sandwich.
No.
Bye, Daddy.
~ Said goodbye to Mom.
~ Yes.
And no tears, guys.
I have a stomach ache, it's weighing me down. I'm hungry.
And you still tell me to bring my backpack, right?
~ No...
~ I still have some sweets.
You've eaten all yours and now you want to share mine?
That's not what I meant, why did you say that?
It tempted me --- now give me some.
Can I have it?
No.
If you won't share, split the cash.
We'll see how you spend it by yourself at the border.
See you in Menton, if you escape.
I can manage alone, but you --- I don't know.
If you don't want to share, that's fine,
I'm hefting a 38 kg...
I have 38 kilograms to handle,
and you only weigh 25.
I weigh 28 kÃ­los.
Anyway, it weighs 10 kÃ­los more than you, so you should give me something.
Well, you decide. If you don't, you're on your own.
~ No, I'm keeping them.
~ Okay, fuck it.
I'll give you one, but it's the last one.
~ The Father plays.
~ Spades.
Well, since it's spades.
Liar...
~ Ah, no! This is mine.
~ No, no.
Do not cheat, Father.
You shouldn't be cheating, Father.
You're right, we shouldn't cheat.
15 minutes for the ID check. ID required.
Please do not get off the train.
Stop! You!
~ Stop right there.
~ No one leaves the train.
The train from Paris will be on the platform number two.
15 minutes for the ID check. ID required.
Prepare documentation.
Sir, my brother and I --- we have no documents.
Documentation.
~ Here come the Germans.
~ Aren't you documented?
Prepare documentation.
~ How can this be?
~ Come on, help us out.
Documentation? Let's see that.
~ Just say we're going with you.
~ And will that be enough?
Please, sir.
~ How are you traveling without documents?
~ We lost them.
Documentation.
~ I can see their documents?
~ Do not say anything.
~ What about the children?
~ They're with me.
Oh, OK.
~ You looking for the coffee shop?
~ Yes.
You should take that shortcut.
Go straight on and eventually turn right.
~ You're not pulling my leg?
~ No, of course not.
Hurry, if you want to arrive before the others.
Come on, Joe.
Push off.
Listen, don't pull stupid stunts, because...
Who's full of shit, then?
I warn you, this town's crawling with Germans.
Full of Germans.
It is difficult to pass through.
We'll see.
Old man BÃ©dard takes people through for 5,000 francs.
I don't have that much loot.
We've failed.
We can't get through with our 6,000 francs.
What do we do?
~ Is your brother?
~ Yes.
We'll never get enough.
I can do it for 1,000 ""marbles"".
~ Okay.
~ How will we get out?
Now go to the coffee house.
~ Yes, we'll go for some coffee.
~ Come on.
Can I have a glass of soda, please?
~ That's nice!
~ Here you go.
~ It's pink.
~ Yes.
It's pink, like the roses in my garden.
Where can we find Mr. BÃ©dard?
Mr. BÃ©dard is over at the pool table.
~ There?
~ Yes.
We want to pass the line of demarcation.
It takes 5,000 francs.
Two months ago my brothers passed through...
and they paid 3,000.
I'll take you through for 5,000 francs --- no discounts.
When they paid only 3,000?
How should I know? My price is 5,000.
Not one Less.
They went with you.
~ Pardon?
~ They went with you.
I know nothing about that.
I don't know your brothers.
My price is 5,000 francs, no less.
But we're children. You could do it for 3,000.
No. The risk is the same for kids and grownups. 5,000 francs.
Beat it.
We don't have enough money. What do we do?
~ You'll work something out.
~ But we're children.
Get out! I've had enough.
Scram!
Here we are.
First the money. Then you can hide in there.
A gift.
Is there no chocolate or something?
""Chocolate""? At the price it is?
20 francs.
And that's a friend's price.
~ And if not, how much?
~ Don't bitch about the price.
We were told that we should not haggle.
Scrunch into there.
Come on.
First you.
It's just a matter of crossing the street.
Then you're in the Free Zone.
Come on.
Don't gobble up all the chocolate.
You can eat it in the Free Zone.
~ Just across the street.
~ Do you think he'll do it right?
~ Yeah, you'll see.
~ Bend your head.
Put this bread here.
Don't eat it, right?
I pretend to fetch...
bread baskets...
of standard size.
Ready? Let's go.
~ Be careful, you idiot!
~ Here we go...
Shut up.
Total silence!
~ My hat.
~ Yes.
We haven't seen many Germans.
Well.
Through this garden then a patch of potatoes...
and you cross the road on the other side.
And no nonsense. Don't get caught...
in the potato patch, or you'll be brought back.
~ We've seen hardly any Germans.
~ There's lots of Jews over there.
The Germans aren't too tired to stop rogues.
A question: what about the Jews who are...
with BÃ©dard in the coffee house?
Can't you do anything for them?
They've been there nearly a week.
I don't know how many are sleeping in the cafÃ©.
~ A week? That's awful.
~ They've got no money.
If they had some, your way would work.
I can't handle so many...
and I can't do it every day.
~ Well, head off, now you can ...
~ Do you know what BÃ©dard's planning?
I'm not about to put my nose into BÃ©dard's business.
~ It's those people, I don't want trouble.
~ Do not mess with me.
It would be me who would put my nose in.
It can work.
I don't know, I can escort two or three families.
You don't have the big picture, it's good business.
We split the money 50-50.
Yeah, you do it for money.
Get lost, dirty Jew.
You want to cross the line again? You're like a goat.
What's with you? We were lucky to find Raymond.
They'll also be happy to pay 1,000 ""marbles"" to make it happen.
Well, mount up.
And you, keep still. Not a peep, got that?.
Don't go, Maurice.
Yes, I will. Eat your bread with chocolate.
If anyone saw you, they'd laugh at you.
Listen, I ...
Listen to me.
I know how to make things happen.
I found a way. I'll charge 1,000 francs.
Another 200 meters and you'll have arrived.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
What?
Quick, no time to lose.
I escorted eight people so I've got 4,000 ""marbles"".
I also...
Come on.
It stinks.
What happened now?
I shit my pants.
~ Why did you do that?
~ I thought you weren't coming back.
And that's a good reason to crap yourself?
Okay, get naked.
~ You're a pig.
~ Don't push me so hard.
Raise your arms.
You could have taken your pants off.
Never mind. We have some loot and we crossed the line.
Here's your underpants.
My brother is a pig.
It's not a big show, you know.
To walk well we have to breathe.
With the blisters on my feet who can walk?
To breathe well you have to raise your elbows.
Where did you learn that crap?
I saw ""Paris-Strasbourg"" in the newsreel.
I don't care.
Do it like this:...
one, two, three, four...
While you breathe.
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three, four...See?
~ Look, you're weird.
~ The riders did well.
What do they do when their feet hurt?
My feet hurt, I have blisters.
Do you think I don't hurt?
I'm as tired as you, but I'm striding.
We've just walked three miles and you're broken down?
I'm younger than you but I don't say I'm bushed.
I keep walking.
~ You don't have blisters.
~ One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
~ One, two, three, four.
~ I'm sick of this. I'm resting.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four...
What are you doing?
Shut up.
~ I have the right to scream.
~ And I have the right to sleep.
So sleep, I'm not stopping you. But I'd like to get warm.
And now...let's get moving.
~ Fuck off.
~ No, move it.
Anyone home?
Funny, this reminds me of a story about trappers.
~ Do you know that one?
~ No, I don't care.
I'm not even going to answer that.
You say that you read a lot but not enough, I guess.
But answer me or we don't talk any more, asshole.
I don't want to talk about something I don't know...
and in any case, it's not worth talking about.
If you always told the truth, there wouldn't be much to say.
Look at the wimp who still wears diapers.
Bite me.
~ And this, you like that?
~ Okay.
~ Now drop it.
~ Fuck off.
~ We have to find its butt.
~ Hang on.
~ Which one?
~ Well, how's that?
Great.
Look at this. We'll eat this one.
Here we go.
~ It's better there.
~ Yeah.
You have to know how to get by in life.
The bitch! There.
In five or ten minutes it'll be cooked on the inside...
and we'll eat it.
I have to pee --- come with me?
I don't need to. Go by yourself, if you like.
~ Why are you shoving me back?
~ What's wrong, boy?
~ What were you doing there?
~ I didn't hurt anybody, sir.
Why are you running around?
Where are your parents?
Did you swallow your tongue? Answer me!
~ I don't know.
~ Where are your parents?
There.
~ That's your father?
~ He's the one standing there.
OK, go on.
And hurry, eh?
Sir, kiss me. I'll explain later.
~ What?
~ I'll explain in a minute.
~ Why?
~ Kiss me, talk to me.
~ But what's going on?
~ I'll tell you, but it's important.
Well, what do you want?
I'll tell you in a minute but now I can't.
What? Tell me. Hang on, wait.
Â¤ Hairdresser --- Ladies and Gentlemen Â¤
Ladies and gentlemen,...
I present the only singer in the world...
with hair on his tonsils.
Interpreting for you a song from their repertoire.
~ Sing, walk.
~ No, no singing.
Serenade Indochina,...
sweet chorus full of ecstasy.
~ Let me alone.
~ With tenderness listen...
in the rice fields of China.
~ Now sing, shut up.
~ It's a sublime song.
~ Come, sing.
~ Come, Joe.
~ One, two, three...
~ It's a redneck.
~ Be careful, you'll hurt him.
~ He always pisses me off.
Why don't you sing, you idiot?
Where did you learn those bad words?
That trip toughened you up a bit.
Go on, you sing.
~ Okay, you'll see that voice.
~ Well, let's see.
~ Come!
~ I will sing the Fatmah.
The Fatmah?
A buddy taught me Fatmah are the Arabs.
~ Yes, they are Arab women.
~ Exactly.
~ You are the Fatmah of Menton.
~ Let's see...
Well, go.
Serenade Indochina.
~ In my bed you do not...
~ You don't even know it!
Shut up.
I'm remembering.
Watch the curtains.
~ You haven't budged?
~ No.
Even though it annoys you, I want to read.
We only ask you to cook...
and set the table --- at least that, you're capable of.
And you think you can do anything?
At least I can do more than you.
This afternoon you've only been walking around, so calm down.
I've been locked up at home, about to burst.
How do you make bread? Do you know?
With water, flour...
~ What else?
~ I can't remember.
This is how you make bread?
Who'll work at the bakery tomorrow?
~ You, maybe?
~ Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, now make me believe that you'll work in the bakery.
OK, I don't believe it.
But at least I found gigs. Try to find something yourself.
Sure. Have you looked in a mirror?
It was true.
Maurice had found work,...
but I could find some, too.
Is this Mr. Chaplin's farm?
It's up there.
~ Thanks.
~ It's not far.
~ I'm exhausted.
~ Yes.
~ It's hard.
~ This hurts.
~ Don't you hurt?
~ Yes, I feel an ache.
Be careful with that, because...
that makes it hurt...
You stay straight, so...
~ Like this?
~ Yes.
There's almost no sun.
Some have died as well.
~ Who?
~ My grandfather.
Louisa.
More.
Not like that --- look:
Back off.
Collect these.
Come here, pick them up.
And not so rough.
Not that one, it's damaged.
~ It's free from soil.
~ I tell you it's bad.
~ If he had treasures...
~ The treasure is these potatoes.
Treasures, now.
~ Do not be distracted.
~ Are you hungry? Well.
We roast these tonight.
~ Do you want bread, Mr. Charlot?
~ Yes.
Go ahead, but not too much. There's rationing, you know?
Not everybody eats bread.
Yes, but he has worked all day.
And in the city, what does he eat?
~ He ate well there.
~ Yes? What about eating?
Leaves of carrot?
I have to milk the cows.
Eat up, then we'll go to the barn.
~ Do you know how to milk a cow?
~ Yes.
How do you do it?
You just pull on them.
~ Then we get milk?
~ Yes.
~ I say don't be afraid.
~ It's not happening.
Do not be afraid.
~ There's no milk.
~ Of course there is.
~ Squeeze.
~ No, there's none left.
I say there is.
~ No sale.
~ With both hands.
This one should discharge, too.
Turn your other hand there.
What's that diddling?
~ There's no milk.
~ Yes there is, but you're no good.
Come on.
I've seen it done.
~ No.
~ Sure.
Come on, go on.
But I was 10 years old...
and children should not work.
Help me.
Mr. Charlot said my arms were of soup...
and ended up firing me.
Don't you realized that you swiped it?
What about money? You got money?
No, I didn't.
Why didn't he pay you?
I don't know, maybe I'll get paid some other day.
Walk!
It is no use spitting.
~ Get moving, sleepyhead.
~ Get out of your shell now.
You are about to leave the shell.
Neither has moved out.
~ I win.
~ You haven't reached the goal yet.
Whenever you want to win.
Hey, Joe! Come play.
~ How was your trip?
~ Too long.
Well, well.
And the cost...
~ Is it still higher, Albert?
~ Here we are.
~ Just a little farther.
~ Are you OK?
~ Well...
~ Have you been good?
Well, are you OK?
Who's there?
~ Joe, open.
~ Wait a second, I'm coming.
~ Open up, we're your parents.
~ What are you doing? Open up!
~ I'll be there in a second.
~ What's going on?
~ Open the door.
~ Open up, Joe!
Open at once.
~ Do you want a slush?
~ Do not talk of slush.
ImbÃ©cile.
~ Joe!
~ You never change.
We have made a journey full of dangers,...
and only you can think of is making us wait.
~ Are you okay?
~ Are you stupid?
We all made it.
If you're making a joke, tease everyone.
Why do you put up with him?
~ What?
~ I'll show you the house.
~ The kitchen has lots of light.
~ What's happening with Joe?
~ I wanted to welcome us.
~ Come here, Joe.
Come, look.
~ He's gotten strong.
~ You dropped this.
Now I'll show you upstairs.
Are there any more? This is huge.
~ Here, Maurice.
~ Yes, Mom.
~ Tired of stairs yet?
~ You go.
~ Better now?
~ Mom, have you seen...?
Mom, did you see your room?
We also have the sea, do you realize?
It's here. It was ours,...
but now Henri and Albert sleep here.
~ How did you get the flat?
~ Searching.
~ Dad, come see.
~ Let me, then we'll see.
I think Albert has taken my coat, go check.
You see, we've got the sea in Menton.
But you see what our children have found?
I'll show the rooms. This was ours.
Now it's yours.
You should put a cross there to make us look Christian.
~ They searched for us.
~ Yes, I see.
Come and see your room, here we are now.
~ We are well installed.
~ Is the children's?
No, it's ours. They are at the bottom. I'll show you.
~ It's fantastic.
~ That's it, fine.
~ Let's take a little walk.
~ No.
Do not you think you've done enough crap?
See here, see.
Make peace. After all this time without seeing you...
Give me some, Mom. Thank you.
Did you see how good our son looks? Look.
~ Well, do you like it?
~ I'll love you to death.
You've changed, eh? Idiot...
Lucky you're here, he keeps hitting me....
~ Dad.
~ Thanks, baby.
Come on, quit messing with him.
~ Your health.
~ Here we go.
~ Mom, please...
~ Yes?
Can you get this? I get dizzy.
~ Low.
~ Wait, I'm coming.
No, low right away.
Yes, yes. Coming.
When I have vertigo, I can't feel my feet.
Quick, close the window.
Also, I have something to say.
Well?
They forced my brothers to work in Germany.
We left immediately and settled in Nice.
Push off, Maurice, this isn't for you.
I want to be alone with Mom.
~ Maurice and I thought...
~ Yes?
We swore that if we were stopped, we'd say nothing.
So you're not running into danger.
Besides, I'd never betray you.
Don't say that even as a joke.
Things here are nice and quiet.
They'll never hurt us. Don't think about that.
What time is it, Mama? I have to go to someplace.
No idea. Why do you ask?
I have to go to the shoemaker to bring oil...
to fix the druggist's shoes.
If I don't, he won't give me shaving soap,...
and I need that for the Italians.
With all these stories, you've got to stop...
or you'll get us into trouble.
No, Joe and I know all the Italians.
Yes, but the Italians have occupied us.
Wait up.
~ Bye, Antonella.
~ Goodbye, my love.
""...return to breathe the air dear,...
""quiet taste...""
That's by Gabriele D'Annunzio.
Goodbye.
Ah, my love. 'Til we meet...
~ Good morning.
~ What's up?
We brought three bottles.
How lovely. Let's see.
We struggled but we did it.
Here you go.
Come on, what more do you want?
I wanted to ask you something.
A friend told me...
That older women, when they pay kids...
show it to them.
But show you what?
I don't know, a friend told me.
~ What kind of stories...?
~ I would like that, but...
Even without pay, I don't mind.
Oh, I see.
After all, I'm 15 years old.
~ You're 15?
~ Yes, 15. Right, Joe?
Yeah.
Liar...
Ah, no. Don't touch.
~ A caress.
~ No.
Just once. I have money.
Give me the money.
Well, go ahead.
Gee, who would have thought. Promise you won't tell.
And you, you want a go?
Don't be ashamed.
He's too small.
~ Well, that's enough. Enough.
~ A little more.
~ It's over, ended.
~ A little bit more...
It's over.
So you spent the dough?
Fuck. And you owe me half.
You're paying me sweet fuck all.
Pay up or I'll tell Mom you have been playing with whores.
OK, if we tell her both of us did.
I know why you're angry: you're jealous of me.
But I touched them both.
The Italians left...
and that was fun.
The Germans occupied Nice two days later...
and began the raids.
~ Good morning, Mr. Roger.
~ I bring news.
~ Tonight there will be a raid.
~ Not possible.
I come to tell you not to forget the sheets.
The first thing checked is whether the sheets are hot.
You knows this as well as I do.
We can no longer sleep in our own bed?
~ I do what I can.
~ Every night the same, Mr. Roger.
~ Yes, I know.
~ Take charge.
The doorman always announced raids,...
so I never knew if it was true,...
or if he did it to swipe what little we had.
Father said that first thing the Germans did...
was to see if the beds were warm,...
or signs that someone was living on the floor.
Then they recorded everything and there was nowhere left to hide.
We live almost like animals.
Get used to living like an animal.
Someone stood guard every night.
If there was danger we hid in the maid's room...
which the porter rented us.
Don't blame me, I'm doing you a service.
If I turned you in to these barbarians I'd earn much more.
~ I'm doing you a favor.
~ You wouldn't do something...?
~ You know that...
~ Don't misunderstand me.
You do favors for people but they never appreciate it.
Do you understand?
I have nothing against you.
But understand that we are upset. Every night the same.
I understand that. Well, goodbye.
~ Good evening.
~ Thanks.
You have not been smart.
You insist on standing guard but can't stay awake.
The next time you won't get the chance...
and you'll be sent straight to bed.
This is NOT a game.
Do you understand?
It is not a game.
Well, that's enough.
This is not a cage.
~ Dad, where are you going?
~ We're not in a cage.
~ I'm going to my bed.
~ Ah, no.
~ Dad, you must stay here.
~ No, no.
~ No way.
~ No, no and no.
~ Do not go.
~ Stay.
~ Let me.
~ Dad, no.
~ I want to go to my bed.
~ You're crazy.
Stay with us, nothing's going to happen.
Stop, you stay here.
~ No, no.
~ Yes, with us.
~ Shut up.
~ It's impossible.
Shut up and sit down.
Sit down and stay with us.
Sit down, we'll stay a while longer...
and everyone'll sit down.
~ Come on, relax.
~ Go sit, Albert.
~ Mom, you sit down, too.
~ Wait a bit.
Nothing, I'm out of here. There's nothing for it.
~ There's no way out.
~ Okay, we'll go.
~ Shut up.
~ Well, listen. Keep still.
Leave him alone, OK? We can't go on like this.
~ Be quiet.
~ Quiet.
~ We can't do this.
~ There's no other way.
~ Slowly, slowly.
~ Look at your brothers.
~ I went out.
~ Look at your mother.
We can not continue living like this.
~ Do not make noise.
~ We condemn usury.
~ We condemn usury.
~ Shut up.
~ Anyway, whatever happens, will be.
~ I went down, come on.
Now all of us, come on. Calm down.
We'll pass the same as the others.
~ Hush now.
~ Just go to bed.
Come on down, this is stupid.
~ Wake up.
~ Do not make noise.
~ What?
~ How come you're not awake?
See if you can shut up.
~ Come to bed, kiddo.
~ It's stupid.
Well, what do we do?
If we stay here, he'll give us away.
We must make a decision. It's up to you, Dad.
Listen, Henri:
everyone loves me.
I am well regarded.
And I appreciate that.
They come to me for advice from all over.
But you think I'm an idiot.
I never said that.
~ Let it go.
~ Decide without me.
Get some rest.
You haven't answered.
Tomorrow we'll see.
At least Maurice decides where to place himself and Joe.
We were placed in a youth camp.
Â¤ NEW CROP Â¤
~ Attention.
~ Eyes...front!
Right, right, with the head straight.
Well, forward march.
One, two. Although I sound out today, keep the pace in your heads.
One, two, one, two.
One, two, one, two.
One, two, one, two.
One, two, one, two...Column left..
One, two, one, two...
Dig in your heels. One, two, one, two.
Column left: one, two, one, two.

""France to you is our tribute.
""France, we are children of thy seed,

""History of France.""
It's long, huh?
Silence.
~ ""In the beginning"" ...

You have to explain, they don't know.
""First Tableau: the origins.""
""In the beginning God created
the beautiful land of France.
""When I looked at her, I loved her,...
""and in a burst of happiness felt this beautiful gift.""
~ ""The peasant.""
~ ""The peasant.""
Not like that, look at me.
You have to do it like this.
Like this...and not like this.
Silence.
It's not funny.
Got it? Well, now re-enter, quickly.
There are three tableaux like this.
""Dear public,
""bow to the greatest character of our history.
""He who will uplift the country.""
Here there will be applause. Do it.
""He who will uplift the country.""
Well, good enough. Continue.
""I am the first farmer.""
Very good, that's the tone that should be used.
""Eighth Tableau: modern times.

Well done.
At the entrance of Nice we'll stop for a moment.
I must see a friend.
Only five minutes, and then we go to the races.
Ferdinand's been five minutes by now, right?
If you can't tell the difference between five minutes and half an hour...
then there's no hope for you.
Shall we go see?
Look at that.
""Legs of Paris.""
We said that we'd look for Ferdinand,...
not stop to read.
~ Halt! Stop!
~ Joe, don't follow me.
~ Are you alone?
~ I think so.
~ Stand.
~ Stop! Stop right there!
Quiet, Joe. Joe!
Hold on.
Be strong, Joe.
~ Just these two?
~ That's right.
Come here.
~ Is that the lieutenant?
~ Yes.
You go, Lieutenant.
~ You, stand still there.
~ Already have.
Quick, go up.
Let's go back.
Israel, Esther.
~ Ben Moha.
~ Come on, move.
David Seridan.
When your name's called, leave the row.
~ David Esue Jesse.
~ Keep moving.
Karoubi, Reiner.
Move it, move it.

~ Are you Jewish?
~ Are you a Jew?
No, I'm not Jewish.
And do you think the lady's Jewish?
Do you think the lady is Jewish?
Swipe your finger...
along the nose of the lady.
Swipe your finger over the nose of the lady.
Continue.
Don't stop, until you tell me whether or not it's a Jewish nose.
Continue.
Do not stop until you've said whether or not...
it's the typical vulture nose of the Jews.
I'm Jewish.
Well, young lady.
And you still claim...
that you're not Jewish?
I'm not Jewish.
Or have you suddenly become Jewish?
Yes.
you two.
Are you Jewish brothers?
You are brothers and Jews?
We are not Jews. We come from Algeria.
They're are not Jews. They come from Algeria.
Why were you in that village?
What you were doing at that farm?
We were with Ferdinand.
They were with the other.
We're in the camp, ""New Crop""...
and we went with Ferdinand.
They're in a camp...
and left with this Ferdinand.
He was going to see a friend.
He didn't come back but we wanted to go back to camp.
When he did not return, they went to fetch him.
What did you do?
What did you do?
Where did you go?
We went to find him.
Where are you from?
Algeria.
We came to France on holiday,...
but since the Americans have landed...
in Algeria, we're stuck here.
They were on vacation, but the Americans...
landed in their country and they can't return.
That does not interest me.
We'll see if they are circumcised.
What is ""circumcised""?
Down with your pants and underpants.
~ Are you Jewish?
~ Are you Jewish?
I am not.
Where are you from?
~ Look into my face.
~ Look to the officer.
Drop your pants.
I am from Warsaw.
Lower your underpants.
~ Are you a Jew?
~ No, I'm not Jewish.
You say you're not Jewish?
You say you're not Jewish?
We're Algerians --- you have to believe us.
I swear. We were operated on because we had adhesions.
Get dressed.
~ Where are you from?
~ I am English.
Let her go.
~ Are you Jewish?
~ No, I'm not Jewish.
Why give us this test? We are not Jews, I swear.
We're Catholic, we aren't Jews.
Take them away.
~ Are you Jewish?
~ No.
Ready to sleep.
Get off the mattresses.
It is time to put down the mattresses --- listen to me.
Do not make noise.
~ It's better than sleeping, ma'am.
~ They weigh a lot to me.
It is better than sleep.
You could ask for more mattresses.
It's better this way.
The children are very tired.
Even if we have tickets, we're not going to Germany.
Easy to say.
Why should we?
I've only done the usual song-and-dance.
Yes, but it didn't go over well.
It won't with the Germans, don't you think?
You're always whining.
Anyway, we can't go to Germany.
We're not going.
Hop off the train even if we break something. But we're not going to Germany.
I promise.
Do not go to Germany.
Do not go to Germany.
Do not go to Germany.
I won't go to Germany. I'm not Jewish.
It's no use telling that to me, I'm Jewish.
I'm not Jewish, I am Catholic.
I am Algerian.
I do not believe you. I know you're Jewish.
~ How can you know?
~ I sense it.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Yes.
Well, we are almost engaged.
How old are you?
23.
Have you kissed?
Sure.
~ How many times?
~ Heaps.
And you, do you have a girlfriend?
Why don't you let us go?
We're not Jews.
I promise, we are not Jews.
Wait.
I swear, we were baptized in the Church of the Buffa.
We are Catholic, sir.
We are Catholic.
I swear that we were baptized in the church of the Buffa.
~ Aren't you Jewish?
~ I promise, we're not Jews.
~ You're Jewish.
~ No, I'm not.
Get up.
Come here.
~ We were baptized in the Buffa.
~ What?
I promise you, sir.
But Buffa is not in Algeria, it's in Nice.
I know,...
we were baptized in the Buffa and then taken to Algeria.
Be still and be quiet.
~ When we were kids...
~ You've got 24 hours.
You bring me your birth certificate.
Look at me!
If you don't come back, all the worse for him.
Let him leave the building for 24 hours.
You stay with me.
We have yet to speak of many things, you and me.
~ You say you come from Algiers?
~ Yes, Sir, in Algeria.
~ Where do you live in Algiers?
~ In the street of Jean JaurÃ¨s.
~ What number?
~ The number 10.
What is Algiers like? Describe the city.
Algiers is a big city.
The houses are all white.
It has a large port,...
with many ships.
Ships colored the old red and black.
It's right by a beach.
Our Dad takes us there every Sunday.
And the port, what's its name?
It has no name, we just call it ""the harbor"". It has no name.
Hang him by his feet.
~ You say you were operated on?
~ Yes, sir.
We had adhesions.
~ Where were you operated on?
~ In Algiers.
~ In a hospital?
~ Yes, sir.
What hospital?
What hospital?
I don't remember, I was just a kid.
~ Sir, we're waiting.
~ Please, sir.
Yes, I'm coming.
Sir.
Each week, 2,000 Jews went to the Hotel Excelsior.
I feared being sent with them before Maurice came back.
I spent the time working, even though no one was watching me.
This way.
~ Take him to the kitchen.
~ Yes, sir.
He's assigned here until further notice.
Yes, sir.
Come on, boy, I've got some work for you.
Polish this pot.
~ Can I see my brother?
~ No way.
You're here to work.
A very kind priest will come looking for us soon.
Do you think he'll swing it? Do we get let go?
Of course, I handed over all the papers.
What did they say?
They don't want to believe it, but it worked.
Did you see our parents?
Yeah --- their morale's low, they can hardly go out.
~ Everything will be fixed?
~ I hope so.
Dad gave me a message for you.
He told me to kiss ""little"".
What have you been doing these days?
I've been in the kitchen, working.
You know, Maurice? Thank goodness you're back.
We won't leave, I tell you. We will not leave!
Even though the priest came, they do not want to believe us, or even see the priest.
Don't push us around, not us.
Before it's all over the world.
~ But if ...
~ Tomorrow or next day.
But not today. And the priest ?
He comes to see the Germans, and then...
he hands over the Christening stuff,...
but since we're are circumcised, they don't want to believe us...
and they think we're Jews.
Where's your confidence?
Don't be silly.
~ We'll see how things'll work out soon.
~ We'll never leave.
We'll leave tomorrow or the next day.
If things were right we'd leave this afternoon.
All right, calm down a bit.
Stop telling me to calm down.
Come, come out.
You, over here.
~ Come, come.
~ Hurry, come on.
Hurry, go.
Guard, to your post.
We're almost done with you.
Here.
Spread your legs.
Alain, Bernard, Pierre: clear out.
You Joffos sit down.
I have bad news: they've arrested your father.
On the street, at a documents checkpoint, and...
~ No...
~ He's in the hotel where...
The net's tightening. You've got to run for it.
Get your stuff together.
Come on, Maurice.
I'll get Dad, Joe.
It can't be done. Listen.
Come on, no...
I've got something for you, you'll go to the Alps.
We don't want to go to the Alps.
Get it through your head that you can't go the Hotel Excelsior. It's impossible.
They'd grab us for sure. You're right.
You know how it is.
Are you crazy or what?
You want to leave Dad to die?
It's not letting him die. No, drop it.
Not only that, but you can't go to the Excelsior. I won't let you.
Come on, listen ...
Come on.
Let's go.
Maurice found a job in the village cafÃ©
and I found one in a bookstore.
Good morning, I come from Mr. Subinagui.
~ You know I'm looking for a guy?
~ Yes, sir.
If you work with me, you belong to my house...
and here there's no place for wimps.
~ How old are you?
~ 10 years and a half.
You're not very tall for 10.
I know, I haven't grown for six months,
but I'm strong.
Any serious illness? Were you ever operated on?
I've had nothing, sir.
~ What's your name?
~ Joseph.
Today you will go with me to make the rounds.
Pay close attention.
Tomorrow you'll be on your own...
~ and I won't be there to teach you anything.
~ OK.
~ Do you agree?
~ Yes.
Let's go.
Joseph. Joseph.
~ Do you see those hills?
~ Yes.
I often walk there with my daughter.
~ What's her name?
~ FranÃ§oise.
One Sunday we could all go to the top of a hill.
~ I would like that very much.
~ If you want, sure.
I'm happy when I'm with her, but...
I'm afraid for her at the same time.
Why are you afraid?
A gang of terrorists hangs out there...
to take away all these beauties.
But they won't bother us.
The new France will be poor, Joseph.
And it won't be in my house where you can stuff yourself.
This is my father's room. Don't tell that we've been in here.
I sleep there.
That's me, last year.
Dad took it.
That, too.
Do you like to read?
Do you like romantic books?
I do not know which books are fictional.
They're stories...
about people with good feelings,...
who dream of things, and then work to achieve them.
I'm writing a novel --- would you like to see it?
Sure.
It's a secret, I haven't told anyone.
It's hidden and I don't want you to see where.
Don't look.
Joseph.
When you know better, say you're a romantic.
No. Do not look.
Maybe someday I'll tell you. Wait in the hallway.
What cheek, to talk of duty, when you live behind your books.
Have you forgotten that we have shed blood?
Do you think in my store...
I'm safe from the rabble of the RÃ©sistance?
Well, you're wrong.
In Paris there have been slogans...
for the Party to go into hiding. Is that true?
Of course not. The Party has not decided anything.
~ Are they up to date?
~ I'm here as his representative.
But we want to know.
Hear the words of our leader.
Don't forget what he wrote in his latest editorial:
""I get to the front of Normandy full of confidence.
""The day I set up headquarters,...
""German troops liberate the territory.""
""They hugged each other.
""She was trying to keep her voice from trembling.
""'I have to round up cattle with Dad,...
""'but tomorrow, at seven, I'll wait by the river.
""'Don't tell anyone, is a secret.
""'Sure,' she murmured, 'until tomorrow.'
""The day passed without incident.
""Catherine was so excited, though,...
and did several foolish things.""
Did you like it?
Do you know, I was thinking: we could write together.
I don't have any talent.
I'll write it,...
and when I mess up an idea, you'll help me out.
I won't be able to.
If you want to do it for me,
you should be able to.
""Emotional climax: something that moves,...
""that causes excitement. A moving scene. ""
""Ottoman: a large backless seat...
""which sits in an oriental manner.""
""He wanted not to get involved, not to kiss.""
~ You haven't emoted.
~ Yes, he's moved...
when you have an emotion.
It's not complicated.
""He did not want to be more deeply involved...
""so he kissed her on the eyes,...
""figuring how far he could pursue...
""this abandonment of Emma. ""
Now can I kiss you?
More --- then we'll see.
It's curious that you wrote like that.
It's good, it shines.
""Seeing him so calm, she harbored no suspicion...
""and sat beside him on the ottoman.
""He was upset...
""because she had sat where there was no support.""
What's the back? Where is this leading?
That's not important, you can change things.
""He hugged her tightly, tilting her back...
""but she defended herself,...
""But she defended herself,...
""and since he did not expect her to resist,
""he was angry.""
~ Okay?
~ Yes, it's good.
Just a small kiss.
I didn't know you knew how to kiss.
You know I don't kiss well.
Do you know how?
No more kissing any more. It's very ugly.
Do you want to teach me?
It's better with my friend, you know?
With Antoinette.
Maybe, but it's not right for two girls to kiss.
It's best with one boy and girl.
Yes, but we just did it for practice.
But I messed up, I really liked it.
No, I really think it's wrong for two girls to do it.
I told you we did it for practice.
She said that if she ever went out with AndrÃ©,...
without knowing how to kiss, it would be awful.
Who's AndrÃ©?
The boy who's secretly in love with her.
But if you want to do it with someone,...
it should be a boy, not with another girl.
That doesn't sound right.
It does not keep me from what I like,
and she at least knows how to kiss.
Knows how to kiss, but with another girl.
With a guy, maybe not.
So you're in love with the bookseller's daughter.
Yeah.
~ What's the point?
~ I get the books I want.
You can't even read. Do you know what ""love"" means?
~ Yes.
~ Tell me.
Things of the heart.
To roll on the grass.
You think she wants to roll in the grass with you?
I don't know, we haven't tried that yet.
And what about running? If you don't like grass, that is.
You may not feel like getting wet.
Why do you think the grass is always wet?
Enough talk about grass.
You're like this because you're jealous.
Me? Jealous of you?
Pull the other one.
Over that brat? Maybe when she grows up.
~ Have you seen her face?
~ She has blue eyes and blonde hair.
Blonde and blue eyes? She has brown eyes.
Brown eyes? Buy some glasses.
Check out all the chicks here for...
a girl better than this and call me if you find her.
The first one passing by is prettier than her.
That remains to be seen.
Anyway, she's ugly and taller than you by three heads.
You need a ladder to reach her.
In bed we're at the same height.
In bed...You're already thinking of that?
That would put us in deep shit and Mom would have a stroke.
With your pinprick you couldn't even tickle her.
Do you think she is in love with you?
Yes.
Has she said so?
Â¤ Frenchmen: if you want to shorten the war,...
Â¤ if you do not want our cities targeted by the liberators,...
Â¤ ask, claim, demand,...
Â¤ that Jews in France...
Â¤ be detained in concentration camps,...
Â¤ near the most threatened areas.
Â¤ Time is running out in the patience of the Catholics.
Â¤ Jews who insult our religion,...
Â¤ who kill nuns and priests,...
Â¤ who bombard our cities,...
Â¤ supporting the rebels in the maquis,...
Â¤ should be dealt with blow for blow.
Â¤ The fear of reprisals will make them see reason. Â¤
They should kill all Jews.
They could keep some specimens in a zoo.
That reminds me of a story about the year 2100 or 2200.
~ All Jews had died.
~ Every one of them?
There were only some selected specimens...
in a zoo.
This way, their natural physical handicaps would be clear for all to see.
People would come from everywhere, near and far.
There was a brief speech...
explaining all the evil they caused in the past.
At the end of the story, the radio announced...
that the last individual had died in its cage.
You would not like living in a cage.
I'm not Jewish. Why do you want me in a cage?
Then they'd have to do it to the Jews again.
Why would they do it again?
To kill a second time.
Once would be enough.
I don't see why you're interested.
In addition, there would be less unemployment.
~ Want a cigarette, Joe?
~ No.
Why not ask me if I want one?
Do you smoke?
What are you laughing at?
If you were five years older,...
I could take you out.
But if I were five years older, you'd be 18.
I do not like guys my age,
other than Joseph.
Who?
Joseph.
With girls, I go to bed.
~ Really, they're just for that.
~ You haven't done a single one.
What the fuck, Joe?
What did you do with that whore? Just gave her the money,...
touched her tits, and lay on the bed.
She said: ""Well, that's enough."" And we left. That was it.
So tell me what you did.
Do you want me to believe that you slept with her?
You didn't watch, right?
I'm sorry, but I looked.
In any case, I like romantic guys.
Romantic...the romance is gone.
Guys just think about sleeping with girls.
They're only good for that, and for cooking.
~ Not true.
~ Yes.
The proof is that some are still romantic.
Those who are crazy.
They're not crazy.
~ Do you think you're romantic?
~ I'm just saying they're not crazy.
They might say you're crazy.
~ I'm not like that.
~ Shut up.
~ We have no choice.
~ They're here.
You give me another whiskey.
~ Come with us.
~ Why?
My God.
~ Can I come in?
~ Sure.
~ What's up?
~ I have something to say.
What?
~ I must go away.
~ Why?
Dad's decided, because there's so much going on...
and his friends have said it will now be dangerous.
His friends are dangerous, because if you were right,
everyone would believe them.
~ All his friends would be a threat.
~ The villagers don't understand.
If you kill people like they did,...
it's not going to end well.
Hey, it's not worth discussing.
I came to say goodbye. Am I stupid?
We're not discussing. And you don't need to go.
I don't want to leave, but Dad insists.
He may be right.
He's not.
Do not be sad.
We know that we love each other, even if we're apart.
We have to keep loving each other.
~ You think so?
~ Yes!
Which do you prefer? You want the window open or closed?
It's all the same.
I'll leave it open, OK?
You'll be better there. It's cooler.
Everyone knows that you don't like to sleep alone.
Why not tell me where FranÃ§oise is?
In a safe place --- don't worry about it.
They say you're to blame for Jean being killed.
Who said that?
The baker's son.
~ What will you do now?
~ Enough, Joseph.
The baker has a rope behind his counter.
He says it's to hang old man Mancelier.
He told me other gossip but I won't comment.
You're dying to tell me, so let's hear it.
He asked me: ""That old bastard Mancelier,...
""Does he shit in his pants, yes or no?""
Mr. Mancelier, I'll confess something:...
I'm Jewish.
Don't believe me? So I'm not Jewish?
Leave me alone! No!
I'm innocent!
He sold out!
~ Traitor!
~ Corrupt!
Pig!
Bastard!
Traitor, traitor!
Mancelier wrote of France,...
of honor, and I don't know what else.
Soon, Paris was liberated.
Maurice managed to trade the Americans...
fake cognac for gasoline.
This got us a seat in a car.
Go get her, Albert.
Madame Joffo.
~ No, no.
~ Yes, come. Come on.
Come on, you can do this.
We were so happy to meet up again,...
for photographs in front of our hairdressers...
only we missed Dad.
In a row, please.
Soon we found out that Dad was not coming back.
When he reached the camp, the loudspeaker announced...
that everyone should go through the showers.
Mr. Albert, a minute.
They handed out soap and towels.
He did go into the showers.
What came out of the shower heads was gas.
Our father was killed in Auschwitz."
6,A Balloon for Allah (2011) - full transcript,"When the Norwegian-Turkish filmmaker Nefise Ãzkal Lorentzen was little, she used to send letters to Allah by balloon. Now she wants to send a new balloon to change the role of women in the Muslim culture. By following her grandmother's path as a 'sufi', she embarks on a journey to rediscover the Islam of her mother's mother. The film switches between her actual journey and her dreams. She experiences the diversity of Cairo, Istanbul and Oslo by drinking tea with the Egyptian feminist Nawal El Saadawi, finding hope and inspiration in the life of the 90-year-old author Gamal al-Banna and meeting a young Salafist. On her journey through the labyrinth, it dawns on Nefise that Islam is not the only place to search, but that there are correlations between the three Abrahamic religion and the oppression of women.","SUBTITLE TRACK FROM ITUNES (moviesbyrizzo uploads)
My grandmother told me that I should
always look for the emerald.
Islam was her emerald.
Justice, love and unity.
She told me that the falsified
prophetic statements in Islam, -
- the strict Shariah laws
and macho Imams, -
- had swallowed the light
from the emerald.
Only when all these are removed,
will the emerald start to shine again, -
- and women's suffering will cease.
Grandma was so lucky.
She was free to say
what she meant.
I am not free.
When I criticize Islam
in the Muslim world, -
- I'm considered reform-minded
and progressive.
When I criticize Islam in the West,
my words will be used by -
- anti-immigrant and
anti-Muslim groups.
I am fed up with living
in such a prison.
He won't meet us
if we don't cover our hair.
He wants no perfume or makeup.
He even suggested niqabs.
I will be visiting a young Salafist,
Sheikh Mahmoud Mekki, in Cairo.
His Islam is the exact opposite
of my grandmother's.
Let's try and go inside.
The Salafists view themselves as the
only correct interpreters of the Quran.
For them, all moderate
Muslims are almost heretics.
The reason I agreed to this interview,
- was that it might be beneficial
for people outside the Arab world.
Otherwise I would have insisted on having a
male photographer or director.
How many times have you had
a female photographer film you?
-Never.
-Okay.
-I'm the first one?
-Yes.
I want to tell you something: my wife,
during our six years of marriage,
- has never once left the
house to go shopping.
I do the shopping. She never goes out, except
once every three or four months, with me.
She's happy? And you're happy?
-Yes.
-Okay.
Oh, it's strawberry?
I will learn Arabic. I will.
-Insha'Allah
-That's good.
If I came here without
wearing a hijab...
Do you think you'd have
treated me differently?
I am the same person.
I have the same smile. So do you.
And we share the same religion.
Even I, a Sheikh, if a woman
comes to me unveiled,
- I will have desire for her.
This is my nature as a man.
If a woman wearing an Islamic dress,
- with her face, hair and body
veiled, walks in front of a man,
- while another woman passes
perfumed, wearing modern clothes,
- revealing parts of her hair and body,
- which one of the two would excite the
man and tempt him into committing rape?
So what if the man has nothing to...
He's not going to rape any of them,
because he's a good human being.
In that sense, I'm unsure
what you're talking about.
You are denying man's natural
instinct to desire women.
You can't understand this from
your female point of view,
- whereas I can understand it
because I am a man.
Gamal Al Banna also lives in Cairo.
He has been a target of Islamic extremists,
because of his progressive ideas.
He is now 90 years old.
He has lived with constant
death threats for several years.
His courage gives me hope.
His perspective helps me in my
quest for the emerald I'm seeking.
The woman issue needs a real revolution -
- within the backward Islamic
thought, which is far away -
- from the texts of the Quran, its spirit and
the spirit of Islam in general.
It is difficult for Europeans, whether
right or left, to understand Islam,
- because they can only judge it
by one of two things:
Either by Muslims and their actions,
or by the ideas of religious scholars.
Those are the Europeans' references.
Muslims' situation is shit, just as
the German convert said:
I thank God that I became a Muslim
before I saw Muslims.""
The Islamic scholars' views are in fact against Islam.
As I said before, there
came a time when -
- falsifying Hadiths (the Prophet's sayings),
was considered a necessity -
- and even a virtue. And all the details
(of Shariah) come from the Hadiths,
- as there are no details in the Quran itself.
The Quranic text came down for a
purpose. This purpose is justice.
So if evolution has made this text
unable to achieve justice anymore,
- then we have to change it.
Because the fundament is
the goal of the text, not its letters.
Family mysteries have always
caught my attention.
Gamal's older brother, Hassan Al Banna,
was the founder of the Muslim Brothers, -
- and a leading inspirational force behind
today's Islamic fundamentalism.
How come these brothers have
chosen two so very different Islam?
I wonder if Europeans can understand
the various faces of Islam, at all?
Last night I had a strange dream.
In the dream I sent a balloon to
Allah, and put all my wonder into it.
Suddenly I saw a tent that
looked like the Sufi tent -
- in my grandmother's stories.
Everything was there.
The past, the present and the future.
I had to find an emerald that could
bring a new light to us women.
I was free to go wherever I wanted.
No one asked me if I had a valid
residence permit or a valid passport.
There I saw our origins, Adam and Eve.
Playful, joyful and erotic.
I also wanted to join them.
Time almost stood still.
Eve took an apple, and asked me:
What is your religion?
Why didn't I tell Eve that I'm Muslim?
What kept me silent?
Somehow, I had lost my language.
I am a filmmaker with an accent,
living in-betweenness;
Europe, Asia, Asia, Europe.
I live with images and dreams, which
belong to two different continents, -
- and I tell stories in several broken
hybrid languages.
Don't let them build their houses
on the mountain tops.""
Don't let them send their
daughters to the far-away land.""
- Women are oppressed!
- Even if you sing: ""don't let them
harass mother's precious daughter"",
- you don't hesitate to beat your beloved.
They say that's what it says in the Quran.
- Honestly, mom, I don't know which story
I'm going to choose in this film,
- because it's a very complex subject.
Your choice is different from mine,
- the woman wearing hijab has made
another choice, but all of us share the same goal;
A better and more dignified life.
And what do we need to make our lives better?
- I have to find out.
- All of us need to and have the right to be happy.
- Yes.
- Of course, without stepping on anyone's toes.
- There is something I don't understand.
- What's that, Nefise?
- Why didn't you wish for a daughter?
I mean, why did you always wish for a son?
And then I showed up!
- I wanted a boy because I knew how
girls are oppressed in our society.
I thought of the social oppression towards
women, psychologically as well.
And I thought that a daughter would
be exposed to all of that,
- whereas a son would have no problems.
Look at our five fingers.
They are very important.
- I have five pieces of advice for you.
- Okay, tell me.
- #1 is to educate woman,
- and let her stand on her own feet,
- and understand herself better.
#2; let her make her own decision
in marriage. If it fails,
- she should not be humiliated.
- Okay.
- #3; regarding inheritance,
- daughters and sons should
have equal rights.
#4 is women's career and work situation.
Women should have wage equality,
and should not be harassed at work.
You know, the most important thing for me?
The most horrible of all?
- What?
- Domestic violence.
- What kind of life have you had?
- My life?
- Let's talk about it.
- Let's talk about it.
That's private.
My life? Let me tell you...
I was never oppressed by my family.
What have I done? I finished my education.
I went to medical school, to be a doctor.
I decided my marriage freely, and I also
divorced by my own choice.
- And then?
- I remarried and started a new family.
- I was never oppressed!
- Okay, but did you have a happy life?
I think of my dream.
How can I find the emerald that can
alleviate women's sufferings?
I travel from my biological mother
to my literary mother, -
- the Egyptian feminist, psychiatrist
and novelist, Nawal El Saadawi.
To walk with her in the streets
of Cairo, just after her final exile, -
- is an art in and of itself.
Everyone knows who she is.
Several times I had to clarify to the police
why I had a film camera with me.
I said I made a movie about balloons.
It was okay.
Nawal El Saadawi is the queen of the
progressives, and one of the -
- main opponents to the
Islamic extremists.
She was one of the first
who took up the theme -
- of women, sex and oppression
in the Muslim world.
She knows the bitter taste
of prison and exile.
Last year I met her in the literature
festival in Molde.
There, I had the opportunity to read out
a letter I had written to her.
I don't know how to begin. I'm one of
your daughters you haven't met yet.
Your work has influenced me
for many, many years.
The core of my work has never been
based on hate against religiosity, -
- but based on a great will
to change, interpret, -
- create, repair and inherit.
Which way shall I go, Nawal?
Which fights will be my priority?
Do I need to have a religious,
sexual and cultural identity?
What if my identity becomes a hinder?
I'll put all my balloons
all around Cairo.
-And I'll follow it to Turkey...
-And Norway.
I wrote a letter to God
when I was a child.
-I didn't know where to send it.
-Maybe I know.
-You know his fax?
-I read it in your play.
But I can't send a fax.
I have to send an e-mail.
Maybe he doesn't have e-mail.
We need to in fact
go to the root of the problem.
How do you go to the root?
By asking questions.
What do you mean by that?
When a boy in his childhood
learns at school -
- that he's better than his sister, -
- that he shall inherit
the double of her, -
- that she should be veiled,
and not he, and all that, -
- his conscience is killed.
His sense of justice is killed.
So that's the problem.
I want real secularism.
I need a secular law
and value system.
I don't want a family law
based on religion.
It must be secular.
It's religious in Egypt.
It's religious in many countries.
So your daughter and son
will inherit differently?
According to the law, yes.
Unless I change it myself.
And before I die, I divide my money
equally, and that's what I did.
-So you can do that?
-I did it in my lifetime.
Because I'm free. I own my money.
So I told my daughter and my son
they'd both get an equal share.
I've done it in my lifetime.
But if I die, the government -
- will give my daughter
half of what my son gets.
Because when you ask me
whether Islam allows feminism, -
- then I have to know
what you mean by both.
Because everybody has
a definition of feminism.
There are many forms of feminism,
of Islam, Christianity and Judaism.
Every country,
every group, interprets -
- religion, feminism and humanism
according to their own interests.
If men are going to have this,
I want to have it too.
I don't want to have this one. I want
to have the same. Feminism is justice.
And what is Islam to you?
That's...
Islam is...
I can't say it's justice.
I'm more attached to Muslim culture
than to Christian culture.
Though I live in a Christian country,
have a Christian husband, my kids...
-You're married to a Christian?
-A Norwegian man.
And the thing is...
I'm very attached to Sufism, and
I'm really attached to spirituality.
And I feel like my existence...
I feel like my existence
is related to others.
-I need you to be myself.
-Exactly. That is creativity.
So as I told you, you know,
the existence in the culture -
- where I grew up...
I don't need to say who I am.
Because we have so many
hidden things that we can say.
So many small words
we can use to in a way -
- tell our hidden stories
to each other.
That's why your mother was unhappy.
My mother died young.
She was unhappy.
It's true that women are unhappy -
- regardless whether they live
in Oslo, Turkey or Egypt.
Whether they are poor or rich.
Even rich women are unhappy.
Because it's the patriarchal system,
you know.
So we are all in the same boat.
And we need to show that in films.
And the silence is also very strange.
Many women I know...
In my family.
They are... Let's see...
They have education.
They have economy, money.
And they have good status.
But they have had domestic violence.
When these women, very strong
women, doctors, lawyers, teachers, -
- when they experience violence, -
- they don't talk about it.
Because it's not nice
to be a broken glass.
-You want to be, you know, proper.
-You hide...
And you hide your broken self.
And they don't want me
to talk about it, because...
It's not nice to be a broken glass.
-Yes, exactly.
-It's not.
I love that. I love this expression,
a broken glass.
But I feel I am a witness -
- to much sorrow
and much unhappiness.
And I myself haven't experienced
either domestic violence -
- or violence in society.
I'm the lucky generation.
I feel kind of... I don't know...
guilty that's I'm the one -
- who receives all the time.
The one who receives and receives.
I want to give back.
Through films and everything.
Talking about women's situation
is also a very private thing for me.
But...
But it's difficult because
they don't want to talk about it.
We have lost our true self.
Now, in those moments you were
crying, you were the real one.
You brought your real self out.
But we are afraid, you know?
The first fear in our lives is to
be real, to bring out our real self.
-Yes.
-That's it.
How can we bring it into films?
When I write a novel,
I try to bring my real self.
-What is your real self?
-Despite everything, -
- the one that is full of fears
and tears. Fears and tears.
All my life, I've been
getting rid of my fears.
Tell me about your fears.
What are you afraid of?
-Say it, say it!
-Okay.
If I come from Istanbul and make a
film about how women have suffered...
How my mother has suffered,
my aunts have suffered.
I can make a film. I can be
like a bulldozer, you know?
And I see myself...
Oh my God.
And I see myself in Oslo.
And if I'm saying the same things...
Real things.
Real criticism.
Then... If...
-Then it doesn't work.
-I know.
This split in me makes me cry.
When a man marries a woman,
- he may later discover
that she has flaws.
There are 3 solutions:
The first is to divorce her,
- which will destroy the home
and harm the children;
The second is to stay with her
while hating the situation;
The third is to marry a new wife without
ruining the first marriage,
- and at the same time making it easier to accept his
first wife's flaws by having another one.
And statistics prove that there are up to 7 times as
many women in the world as there are men,
- so if I give only one woman to every man,
I will have condemned millions of women -
- to remain unmarried. Is that
the kind of justice the liberals want?
As a fundamental rule in Islam,
a woman is seen as a precious jewel.
Thus I ask: if you have a jewel,
- will you leave it unprotected
in the street, for anyone to grab,
- or will you keep it in a velvet box, and hide it from
everyone except yourself, the owner of the jewel?
What's on a Muslim woman's mind
when she meets a fireman?
Lust?
Well then, he must be protected.
What does a Muslim woman feel
when she meets an officer?
Desire?
He should be covered.
What makes a Muslim woman excited
when she meets a carpenter?
His naked body?
Sex?
He should be wrapped.
What's on a Muslim woman's mind
when she meets a doctor?
Orgasm?
He must be hidden away.
We don't believe in hijab at all,
- but as for niqab, we see it
as a stain of shame.
It is 100% unacceptable, because it
erases a woman's personality,
- and paralyzes her freedom
to work and to truly participate.
Even the glance the Salafists consider a sin,
- let alone intermingling or kissing!
The last fatwa that we
recieved from Saudi Arabia -
- says that anyone who permits
intermingling is a pimp!
Of course, their talk is just nonsense.
Polygamy in the Quran was allowed
in order to limit polygamy,
- because polygamy was
widespread among Arabs.
A man could marry 8 or even 10 women.
Islam wanted to resist that trend,
- so there came a very strange
Quranic verse (4:3).
This verse has one condition at
the beginning and another at the end,
- for polygamy to be permissable.
Muslims have neither understood
the first nor the second condition;
they just kept marrying!
The only part they understood form the verse was
Marry women of your choice, 2, 3, or 4.
A ""polytheist"", in the Quran, referred to
the Arabs who worshipped idols -
- and were the enemies of Islam.
There was always a war going on against them.
So, what is prohibited in Islam is not that a
Muslim woman marries a Jew or a Christian,
- but that she marries a polytheist.
However, we can no longer say -
- that today's Buddhists, for example,
or the adherents of a Chinese religion -
- are polytheists like the polytheists back in
the time when Islam first came into being.
Maybe in the past, a woman
was not autonomous,
- and was too shy to speak out
when a suitor proposed.
Nowadays, women aren't
shy at all, thanks God!
She has the right to decide
freely about marriage,
- without needing the consent
of any ""guardian"".
We also believe that divorce should be
validated in the same way as marriage,
- that is through mutual consent.
But that a man monopolizes
the right to instant divorce,
- just by saying ""you are divorced!"" -
- this should have no value at all.
Even if he keeps saying the words all
day and night, it is pure nonsense!
I can give you an example of the difference
between the Quran and Muslims' conceptions:
If a Muslim hears a rumor about
his wife betraying him,
- he will grab a knife and kill her,
exclaiming ""my honor!""
The Quran is totally different.
In the Quran, even if a man saw
with his own eyes -
- his wife in bed with another man,
- he couldn't do anything to her.
Why? Because there are no witnesses.
There are three crimes for which
execution is instituted:
if a man or a woman leaves Islam,
- commits adultery or commits murder.
But can a Muslim woman
marry a Christian man?
The Prophet, praise be upon him, said
whoever changes his religion, kill him!
The case is not as most people think,
that there is an absolute freedom of faith.
So when a Muslim woman
marries a non-Muslim,
- she may be influenced by his religion
and may leave Islam.
And if she leaves her religion,
it would be obligatory for us Muslims -
- (via the Islamic state) to kill her for apostasy.
This issue has harmful consequences
in both respects:
In this life, an apostate should be killed,
and in the next, he/she will burn in Hell.
Let there be no compulsion in religion.
This is written in the Quran.
I don't know how one can interpret this
as a justification for violence and hatred.
I hope that my children, in the future,
through their marriages and their lives,
- will bring new religions, new cultures
and new languages to our family.
It isn't just the fundamentalists,
but also the media -
- which is obsessed with the fall
and misery of Muslim women.
The world is fixated on statistics!
Now it's my turn to be measured.
My sexual oppression level is 52.
My cultural oppression measures 78.
My longing for freedom increases
when I see the progressive Muslims -
who want to create a new democratic Islam
and change women's oppression -
- in this patriarchal culture.
This demonstration is against
the violence and aggression.
The majority of Muslims
need to be aware -
- that silence can give
a wrong impression -
- of supporting those who do
violence in the name of Islam.
I like your balloon to God.
It's like my letter to God.
When I was a child, I was very
furious. So I went to my room -
- and wrote a letter to God.
I told him, ""Dear God.""
My grandmother told me
that you are justice.""
But now I face injustice
in the family, in your name.""
Because they preferred my brother,
though I am much better in school.""
Because he is a boy. They say
you said so. Did you say that?""
Because if you prefer boys to girls,
you are unjust,"" -
- ""and I am not ready
to believe in you.""
I feel that my God is in me.
And God... In Turkish,
we don't have ""she"" and ""he"".
So my God is sitting inside me,
but without any gender, genderless.
And God moves in my body, and
this is how I feel it protects me.
You must explain what you
mean by God in your body.
Is it your liver, your spleen?
-Your uterus? What's in your body?
-It's everything.
-It's in your mind.
-My brain. My imagination.
It's the idea, yes.
Imagine the idea of God.
The idea of justice.
The word of God in the Old Testament,
The New Testament, the Quran, -
- the word of God is not clear.
One needs human beings
to clarify the word of God.
My next destination is Turkey.
I will film a seminar where,
for the first time in history, -
- will be trained about women's rights
and violence against women.
This is just amazing!
All the Imams in Turkey
will take this course.
- When did you start giving courses to Imams?
- We have been working on it for two years.
- The issue of violence towards women
is a very touchy subject.
I think what you're doing is very important,
- but there are still groups in Turkey
where men legitimize beating their wives,
- because they see themselves as
masters of the household.
Imams have immense importance
in the shaping of the perception -
- of what is right and what is wrong.
And still, many men think they can
beat women in the name of Allah.
So absurd.
- We Imams have incredible power.
A woman came to me, and thought that
the domestic violence she was suffering,
- was her payment to God,
and was meant to happen.
She said: ""it's true, my husband beats me,
but if I'm patient,""
- I will earn my place in heaven.
I don't advise her to contact the
police, but I enlighten her.
She says: ""my husband
prays five times a day.""
I find him at work and
drink tea with him.
I tell him: ""if you beat your wife ever again,
I will publically disgrace you,""
- which is easy in a small community.
- But what if he tells you to stay out of his business?
- Oh, he wouldn't dare!
- Our ways of understanding
Islam might be different.
I don't think I need to use hijab
in order to call myself a Muslim.
- In my understanding, you
don't need to use hijab either.
I cover myself out of personal choice,
- but you are just as free to be a
Muslim and still wear a bathing suit.
- A Salafist sheikh from Egypt, told me that
a Muslim woman in an interfaith marriage,
- can be killed if she leaves Islam.
- It has nothing to do with Islam. It shows
how his ideas are associated with violence.
The writer of the Koran is Allah.
He has spoken once
before, now he is silent.
Who is talking now? We are talking.
Nobody can speak on Allah's behalf.
- Even if a woman won't admit
she's being physically abused,
- you are like doctors,
- who look at her bruises,
- and determine when
and how they occurred.
You have that same ability
to discover such things,
- only you are doctors of the soul.
- Do we have any examples of
Mohammed beating his wives?
Isn't it about time we found a new
translation for the word ""beat""?
- Your question is very good.
Why do we create this distance
between us and violence?
Even though we all seem
to agree inside this room,
- our male sub-consciousness
will always be in us.
As an Imam, I don't know if I'm able
to see this issue objectively,
- without the influence of
customs and traditions.
- It's very simple; we raise our
daughters and sons alike.
Now I've gotten reactions from some Imams,
- who think that boys
should be raised as warriors.
I told them that I have two sons, and
I don't want any of them to be warriors.
When the Imams speak about
a new interpretation of the Quran, -
- it triggers my imagination.
In the Quran it says:
if your wife is disobedient, -
- you should first talk to her,
then throw her out of bed, -
- and if she is still not obedient,
you should beat her.
But what is the instruction for women?
What should a Muslim woman do
if her husband isn't obedient?
First of all, she should talk to him.
Then, she should throw
him out of her bed.
No sex for you, darling.
And finally, she should beat him.
Or should we find a new
interpretation of the word ""beat""?
Islam is not the only religion
struggling with its views on women.
Islam, Christianity and Judaism
share the same origin: Abraham.
And these 3 religions also have in
common their belief in only one God.
And they all have a history of
the oppression of women.
I wish the women of these 3 religions
would talk together more.
We have scriptures -
- that tell us to shut up
and hide, in a way.
Christianity tells us
that women should be silent.
It's Paul, isn't it?
He's particularly good
at that, isn't he?
The question that remained, was why
this God, neither male nor female, -
- should speak to empower men?
Judaism separates
women and men in prayer.
That can take a variety of forms.
Traditionally, if you go into
older synagogues in Europe, -
- you'll find balconies. The women
were meant to be on balconies.
Behind latticework or some sort of...
partition of some description.
It was thought that men were unable
to pray if they could see women.
I find that line of reasoning -
- oppressive to women's spirituality
and demeaning to men.
Is having female religious leaders
important to prevent violence?
I don't romanticize women. Women
are not necessarily better than men.
Women do some things differently.
Call attention to other perspectives.
That's absolutely a responsibility.
The Muslim reading of the Quran -
- is that there's complete equality
in the religious domain.
But women are inferior in society, -
- which strikes me as a really
incoherent argument. It's like:
So women and men
are equal before God,"" -
- ""but unequal in the eyes of men?""
How did we get there?
If I'm in Pakistan, my awareness,
intelligence and knowledge -
- counts for nothing.
Because the system
is already centered on males.
Even to speak as a Muslim woman, -
- an interpreter of the Quran,
is like, ""Who are you?""
Asma Barlas is one of the most important
contemporary female interpreters of Islam.
For hundreds of years, there
have been only men -
- who have told us how the
Quran should be interpreted.
Now is the time to hear how
women read the text.
You know, I first found
you on the Internet.
I was goggling Muslim feminists.
Even though you don't call
yourself a feminist. Why?
Well, I think...
Once you use that label, many other
conversations get shut down.
My country was colonized by Britain.
It was disturbing to see that, even -
- among modern feminists, there's
this notion of rescuing the other.
And for many Western feminists,
Muslim women are the other.
A long time ago, through orientalism,
Muslim women were described as nude.
All the Turkish harems, the theme
of all the famous orientalists.
All those women lolling around, semi-
naked in Turkish baths and hamams.
And they always have this style.
That was the other.
European notions have also changed.
Western feminists love this, because
it's the exact opposite of them.
They associate freedom with nudity.
But historically only slaves
were denied clothing.
It's always, ""Muslim women are
helpless, who shall rescue them?""
Feminists? The West?
Anyone can call themselves feminists
now, even Bush and his wife.
They use women to justify war.
I also want to speak directly
to Muslims worldwide.
We respect your faith.
But we condemn the Taliban regime!
If I understand you correctly,
you say no to some of the hadiths.
I say no to all the hadiths which are
contrary to the Quran or undercut it.
We cannot attribute something to
the Prophet that would undermine him.
Which runs contrary to his methods.
It's simple.
Anyone could figure it out.
The parts of the Quran that describe
women's relationship to God, -
- have mostly been stamped out of the
scripture, usually through the law.
Much of it is done through
secondary religious texts.
-And certain changes need to happen.
-So we need to have reform in Islam?
If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't
be reading the Quran as a text -
- with multiple possibilities.
So why do we continue to make bad
choices? Give me one good reason.
They claim it's in the Quran.
Then say it's in the hadiths.
You say, ""Why accept hadiths
that contradict the word of God?""
Then they say it's in the Sharia or
the Sunnah. They keep evading you.
Just like you have a particular
understanding and relationship -
- to Islam through your grandma,
I have a relationship to Islam -
- through my understanding
of the scripture.
This is grandmother again.
-My goodness!
-And this is her.
You were pretty serious.
And it was actually she who
taught me how to be a good Muslim.
Sharia is a human interpretation
of provisions in the Quran -
- to make laws out of it. It's not
a law book, but a scripture.
But many people do that.
Many nations do that.
And in many Islamic nations they use
the Quran as Sharia, as a law book.
We should see which verses of
the Quran would be different now.
Taking the same meaning
without the institution is foolish.
So it means that, in that sense,
there are some verses in the Quran...
I don't mean we can freeze them,
but read them as a historical fact.
Yes.
Imagine that the story
goes like this:
Once upon a time, there were
One of them had a cross,
another a Star of David -
- and the third had a crescent.
They gathered around
an apple tree -
- that had once introduced
the misery in the world.
These 3 religious sisters
wanted new interpretations -
- of the sacred writings.
Women's lives would no longer be
characterized by suffering and violence,
- but by freedom and love.
Such a religion would give space
to women, and also to me.
I had a dream that I sent
a balloon to Allah.
Now I look forward to getting an answer."

Blow on it.
OK.
- Water.
- OK.
- Newspaper.
- OK.
- My back itches.
- OK.
- Lower. - OK.
- There! - OK.
You've got a harem today, Shikano!
- That's good.
- OK.
Your pillow.
Here you go.
- Ramen!
- OK.
Where are your eyes going?
Your boobs are marvelous!
Cut it out!
- Amazing.
- No!
Let's just wash him.
- Be careful.
- Okay.
His back hurts.
- Be gentle. - Okay.
Just don't hurt me.
A little more.
You're the new volunteer?
What?
We're training now. Come here!
But I...
How's little John today?
Hey, your rash is better.
Darn! I wanted the new girl
to put ointment on it!
I'm back.
Hi.
Tanaka, what took you so long?
Here's your hamburger.
Wrong! I told you Mos Burger!
Oh...
You need to listen better!
Sorry.
What?
Misaki?
You know her?
- Well... - Say...
Did Tanaka recruit you?
I'm glad a cutie is here.
Ow ow ow! Don't push the bone.
Me?
Yes, you!
Why are you here?
Checking on you.
I never get to see you.
I told you I'm volunteering
for med school.
Glad you're not cheating on me.
But put this before me?
I'll be done tonight.
Let's get dinner.
Some place good!
What, you're cancelling?!
I need someone
to spend the night.
I can't turn over by myself.
Whatever!
- Takako. - Yes.
Seto can't come tonight.
What?
That jerk.
What will I do?
We'll find someone else.
How could he? I have MD!
(Muscular Dystrophy)
Oh.
Tanaka, you heard that?
Yes.
You can stay tonight, right?
Well...
An aspiring doctor can't
abandon a patient.
- OK. - Oh no...
Thank you! I'm relieved.
What?
Your name is Misaki?
Why don't you stay too?
Tanaka might screw up.
Why'd you apply?
But I...
He likes you! You'll do great.
Tonight will be fun!
No no no no...
You study education?
Training to be a teacher?
Give me wine.
Come to my symposium?
Show her the flyer.
Here.
""Independent living
for people with disabilities""
Instead of depending
on family and facilities,
I want to make
a society that knows
people with disabilities
are all around.
If the disabled say my lifestyle
gives them hope,
I can't deny it.
- Misaki! - What?
You like movies?
Not really.
Then music?
Let's go to a jazz concert.
But I think she's busy...
I wasn't asking you.
I'm talking to her.
But it's after 2 a.m.
I'm totally fine.
I can't sleep anyway.
I'm hungry.
You should sleep...
I want a banana.
We have none.
Buy one somewhere.
I can't sleep without it.
A banana!
OK. I'll go look.
Thanks. Take my wallet.
Sorry.
I'll go!
You too?
One of you stay.
It's late.
Don't leave me alone
with that guy.
Shikano, I'll get your banana.
Crap!
""Bananas 100 yen""
""Closed""
51.
You think she likes me?
Well, but...maybe.
Why just ""maybe""? Hype me up.
Sorry.
31.
I found a banana.
Wow!
I just felt something amazing!
A BANANA? AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT?
So what's happening
with that med student?
C'mon, Misaki! You can't abandon
our group dates.
Have you done it with him?
Um...well...
His dad runs
Tanaka Hospital, right?
Yeah.
Sure he's not
just playing around?
He's not like that.
I'll be going to his house.
No way! To meet his parents?
For marriage?!
But he's still a student.
No fair! Set me up with
one of his friends.
I'll try.
I'll get it.
Miyataya Coffee.
May I speak with Misaki Ando?
Shut up! Are you Tanaka?
Could you volunteer again?
Why me?
Shikano signed
you up for a shift.
Why? Couldn't you say no?
You made him
a little too happy...
But I'll be there that day.
We can go out afterward.
Hold on.
Why do all this for him?
He doesn't want to
end up at a hospital.
They thought
he'd be dead by 20.
But he's been living at home,
and now he's 34.
Hmm...
He's amazing.
Sorry, I gotta go.
Please. I'm counting on you.
Hold on...
Salmon.
It tastes better
when you feed me.
It's the same.
Yotsumoto can stay Tuesday night.
Then I'll be going. See you.
- Thanks!
- Thanks!
Rice.
Shikano, can Takako make it
on Sunday?
Yes.
Then Saturday night...
- Is it here?
- I know you're busy, but...
We can't find someone
- for the weekend.
- See you!
- Thanks.
- Bye.
Really?
Oh good!
Glad we filled that slot.
Tanaka?
The clock stopped.
Is it the battery?
Maybe.
Water.
We're out of batteries.
I'll go get some.
- Take his wallet.
- Ok.
- Bring the receipt.
- Ok.
Oh, and also...
Ground coffee, 200 grams.
A Dom Dom burger,
vanilla ice cream.
Town magazine, and...
You know...
Girlie magazine. Right?
Right?
Don't say it so loud!
The volunteers
always ask for it...
Taka, my butt hurts.
Oh.
Here.
He gets bedsores
from sitting too long.
Oh.
That's good.
OK.
You're good at this, Misaki.
Can you do it every day?
Your beard
doesn't grow every day.
Yes, it does!
Some people shave twice a day.
Wait! Don't wipe me.
I want her to.
Sorry.
Also,
his cardiotonic and diuretic.
Don't mix up his meds.
You've gotten good at training.
Oh, thanks.
- Posture change!
- Yes.
That means, help him turn over.
It's kinda hard.
But once you get it,
you can do it alone.
Learn it, Misaki.
- How's this?
- Ok.
What next...
Maybe the kitchen.
Ow ow ow!
Ow ow ow!
Sorry.
You trying to kill me?
Sorry.
My shoulder!
Just take it easy or
you'll never be good at it.
I got wine.
Thanks.
And your salami.
Jonouchi, you know what I like!
And I invited a friend
to next month's symposium.
That makes me happy.
""I push people around""
""because I want to show
timid young people""
""that asking others for favors
is part of being alive.""
Your words moved me.
You get it!
By the way, about tonight...
A family thing came up.
What? Really...
Oh...
I'm screwed.
Tsukada, can you stay tonight?
I have work.
Right...
Tanaka?
You can stay, can't you?
He has a date tonight.
A date?
A date!
You can do that anytime!
How could a med student do this?
Jonouchi, cigarette.
Ok.
You really should stop smoking.
Shut up! I do what I want.
Shikano, who do you think you are?
What?
You think being disabled
makes you special?
So you can say anything?
Misaki, stop...
These volunteers are spending
their precious time to help you.
What do you mean by ""their time""?
They learn from me.
They say it's equal.
Don't you realize
how kind they are?
Keep this up and
they'll stop coming.
No one quits.
They all love me.
They do. But I don't.
Oh, so now you think
you're special.
You're awful.
I'm never coming back.
Good. Don't come back!
Do I really have to
watch this with you?
It's embarrassing for me
to have you wait
in the other room.
Isn't it more embarrassing
to have me here?
Fast forward it.
Ok.
Stop.
It's no use. I can't concentrate.
Get a pen and stationery.
What?
I'm writing a letter.
A letter?
- Do it!
- Ok.
""Dear Misaki Ando,""
""I'm terribly sorry about
the other day.""
It's to Misaki?
Yeah. Just write it.
Me?
My handwriting's getting worse.
Just write.
""Dear Misaki Ando,""
""I'm terribly sorry about
the other day.""
- ""I made you angry...""
- Hold on. Just a moment.
""I'm terribly...""
""I'm terribly sorry about
the other day.""
Write neatly!
""...the other day.""
""I made you angry,""
""and I'm sorry.""
""I'm sorry.""
""However,""
""please understand me.""
...
""What can I say...""
""I've fallen in love with you.""
You're writing that?
That's the most important part.
Skip a line there.
""I want the chance to apologize.""
""I'd like to invite you to dinner.""
""Simply put,
I'm asking you on a date.""
""Please consider it.""
Nice handwriting.
- Hey, I wrote it.
- What?
Volunteers can't
say no to anything.
These are also from him.
What is this volunteering, anyway?
What?
Why do you do so much for him?
Just to feel good about yourself?
He needs help.
Can you go on a date with him?
Aren't we a couple?
Yeah. Of course.
Is offering your girlfriend
part of volunteering?
...
It's not that! I mean...
It'll really make him happy. Please!
Just this once, OK?
Please.
Then do something for me.
Of course.
- No way. Here?
- Yes.
You mean now?
Now!
Now?
Ok.
Misaki!
Misaki!
Misaki!
He looks really happy.
Going out is his favorite thing.
Thanks for coming!
Isn't this great?
Sure is!
Don't grill it too much.
Keep it rare.
This is fun!
My first date in a long time.
You dated a lot before?
I was a popular guy! But that
caused trouble with my wife.
Wife?
You were married?
That was the happiest time of my life.
But then she cheated on you.
That was my low point.
But it's not like it killed me.
I decided to chase my dreams.
What are your dreams?
I have lots.
To eat Sapporo ramen.
To travel to Biei.
And to be on a talk show.
But your biggest
is to go to America.
What?
There's an activist
named Eddie Young.
He inspired me
to live independently.
Shikano wants to meet him,
so he's learning English.
It was hard to study in junior high.
Took me forever to pass
the Level 3 exam.
Now he's going for Level 2.
Anyway, I eventually
wanna be famous.
Famous?
So you can change
Japanese society?
That too.
But to get more volunteers.
I can't live without volunteers.
You just want to be adored
and get women!
No! It's for Japanese society!
Oh, there's that noise again.
Rock music...
I love this song!
Really?
Maybe rock's OK sometimes.
Misaki.
How far will we go tonight?
Will we stay here forever?
I'm gonna explode
Being alive is too wonderful
I want you to kiss me
So we can get closer to our dreams
I want you to kiss me
Look, he's having a blast.
I'm glad he's having fun.
What's wrong?
What is it?
Sorry...
What?
I ate too much rare meat.
What?
- I can't hold it.
- Ok.
Oh no.
Oh no, oh no.
This is awful.
Just a little more!
- Almost there.
- Can you go faster?
Sorry.
The wheelchair restroom
is over there!
Sorry.
Oh no! Here it comes!
I'm gonna lose it!
You just have to
squeeze your muscles.
But my disease
weakens my muscles!
Oh, right.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
It's fine. We brought clothes.
I'm totally fine.
I'm not depressed at all. I'm fine.
I don't care.
Ha! This is hilarious.
That really got to him.
It's painful to hear him say this!
It's OK. Everyone poops
their pants sometimes.
What?
You too?
I took my university exam
in soiled pants.
No way!
It's true.
You rock!
Let's all go to karaoke sometime!
- Sounds fun!
- Doesn't it?
We should go, Shikano.
Are you sure?
But women lose their minds
when they hear me sing!
Really?
You rock.
Your pulse is irregular.
It's your cardiomyopathy dilation.
Your heart is getting weaker.
We're admitting you.
You know more than anyone
how much I hate hospitals!
You're impossible.
You encouraged me
to live independently.
I've lost patience.
That was a mistake.
I can't guarantee you'll live.
What do doctors know about life?
I was told I wouldn't live to be 20.
But I'm still here today.
I'll be responsible for my life.
Takako, turn the tape over.
Just a moment.
Misaki! You're here.
You're working hard.
I want to go to America.
I think I'll find a new me there.
What's your dream?
Mine?
For now, just to
make a good meal.
Then I'll have curry.
Medium spicy.
And we're almost out of
toilet paper and detergent.
Oh, and dumplings.
Is that an order?
I can't go myself
so I have to ask someone.
You don't hold back, do you?
But this is my house!
Who holds back in their own home?
It's totally different
from a hospital.
Got it.
Good afternoon.
Hello!
- Hi, Mrs. Shikano!
- Hi.
Thanks for always taking care
of my stupid son.
Nice to see you!
I've made inari sushi and croquettes.
Take them away!
You're bothering us.
They're not for you.
They're for the volunteers.
Just leave, you old hag!
I know I'm old, but
must you call me a hag?
So rude!
Stop thinking people will do
anything for you!
The guest may leave now!
Fine! Stupid son.
Don't come back!
You're really leaving?
Your son's no angel.
He's quite abusive.
Is it because he's shy?
What can I do? It's all my fault.
No, it's not!
I gave him that body.
Parents of disabled children
always work too hard.
I did everything for him.
But since he decided
to live on his own,
I couldn't help him
even if I wanted to.
He's really a kind boy at heart.
He used to love it
when I made inari sushi.
The elevators in train stations
were built after years
of efforts by the disabled.
Today, the elderly and
parents using strollers
can't do without them.
Our idea is that
by making society
more convenient for the disabled,
society will be more convenient
for everyone.
Are there any other questions?
Yes.
Go ahead, young man.
Do you
have any dreams?
I do.
I want to pass the English exam
and go to America.
I want to see Eddie
who inspired me,
and tour independent living centers.
Could you do that?
Well, I was told
I'd never survive
without family or hospitals,
but now I'm living independently.
If your will is strong,
you can do anything.
And eventually I want
to appear on a talk show.
Why did you decide
to live independently?
I made an amazing friend
named Kuwajima.
He goes to theaters and discos
in a wheelchair.
I was jealous about
how many girls he got.
So I wanted to go out, too.
You just wanted girls?
Yes.
But wasn't it hard
to find volunteers
and teach them care?
Well, I can't do anything
unless I ask someone for help.
It takes courage to ask
other people to help you.
Thank you!
You made all this?
I can't guarantee it's good.
I'm so happy!
Shall we?
Thanks.
Let's dig in.
- OK, the blue one.
- Ok.
Let's eat.
Wow!
- It's no good?
- No!
It's too good!
Yes!
Hey, are you free Sunday?
Why?
We talked about
meeting my parents.
Oh. Sure, if it's OK.
- I'll come over.
- Good!
My mom's really set on Sunday.
She'll ask about
future plans, too.
What?
Like what kind of school
you want to teach at.
If you can keep teaching
after we marry.
How many kids we want.
That stuff.
Um...
- Actually...
- It's OK!
We haven't talked about marriage.
No, not that.
Um...
I lied.
What?
I'm not studying education.
Yes?
Sorry.
But it's true that I wanted
to be a teacher.
I had this really nice teacher...
You lied to go to mixers
with med students?
It's not that
I wasn't interested...
But I'm with you
because I love you.
And remember at the restaurant,
that one waiter was terrible?
But you helped him.
What will my parents say?
They'll think I lied to them!
Then I'll apologize.
Is that OK?
Look.
I understand it was
hard to admit it.
I want to be generous
and forgive you.
But why did you wait
until now to tell me?
What if I hadn't said anything?
I can't help but get angry.
You're mad?
You forgive me? Which is it?
You're the one who lied.
Fine.
Then Sunday's cancelled.
What?
You have a boyfriend?
What's he like?
- Actually...
- No, stop.
If you tell me then
I can't ask you out.
But I think it's over.
I shouldn't have lied to him.
- You lied?
- Yes.
About being in school.
What?
In high school I thought about
becoming a teacher.
But I failed, and now
I work part-time.
Pathetic, huh?
I see.
But you wanted him
to like you, right?
My mouth is my only weapon,
so I lie all the time!
So why don't you
turn it into the truth?
What?
Go to school and
become a teacher.
That's easier than taking
the English exam at my age!
We've switched positions.
You're encouraging me.
Our positions are equal.
We're both human.
I'm happy to help you.
And this is my chance.
Yes?
If he dumps you, then I'm next!
Shikano,
what have you lied about?
I've exaggerated about pain,
pretended to be sad.
I put on an act
to keep my volunteers!
And you really want
your mom's help, right?
I wanted my mom.
She was busy with work.
If I relied on my mother,
she'd spend all her time on me.
I want my parents
to live their lives.
And it's hard to hear them say
my disease is their fault
and to keep apologizing.
Anyway,
people think caring for
the disabled is the family's job.
I'm pushing back
against that idea.
Sorry I'm late.
You're really late! Being on
time is your only good point.
My time's up. See you.
Bye!
What did you wish for?
It's a secret.
Of course I'm not telling!
Come on!
- And you?
- Yes?
To get into university.
What?
I'll take the test next year.
I've started studying.
Wow! Great.
We should study together.
You going out?
On a date with Misaki?
No.
Oh, hello dear.
Hi.
Where are you going?
Volunteering again?
I won't tell you not to,
but you really need to study
so you can take over the hospital.
I know.
I'll see you later.
Wow! Thanks so much.
Learn all this and you'll
get into the best university.
Oh, Tanaka's staying!
We can play Othello until morning.
Let him sleep!
After you insert
the tracheal tube...
What?
Tanaka!
I'm sorry.
Give me the bag valve.
How can you quit
with a phone call?
You said you'd always help!
I want to help people
who need it.
But you're enjoying your life.
You're carefree and happy.
What are you saying?
I shouldn't enjoy my life?
Don't act like you know me!
Hey...
Hello? Hello?!
He hung up.
That jerk!
You knocked that one!
Doing that makes him feel better.
Shikano,
half of our student volunteers
will graduate in March.
They should all repeat a year!
We'll look for new volunteers.
Let's pass out flyers
at the university.
Right, Tsukada.
Hey, what about my birthday?
We're looking for volunteers!
An MD patient needs help.
Please help.
You'll get good meals!
Here you are.
Thank you!
It's gotten chilly.
This warms me to my heart.
""Volunteers needed""
Hey, didn't you recruit
by yourself at first?
Yeah. I could move
a lot more then.
You're amazing.
You just realized?
I'm always working like crazy.
The ramen here is good.
- I wanna try!
- Let's go!
Tanaka!
What a surprise!
Well, this is my school...
Misaki just asked me out
on a lunch date.
Want to join us?
No, I'll pass.
Why not?
It's spicy!
What?!
You went from a med student
to a guy in a wheelchair?
It's not like that.
But things with Tanaka
came to an end.
But you can't break up!
I wanna meet his friends!
I want a kind, rich, educated,
perfect boyfriend.
But it wasn't working out.
What?
I can be myself around Shikano.
Are you sure it's not sympathy?
Can he go out for meals
or trips in a wheelchair?
And how can you do it with him?
If he has a muscle disease,
can he get it up?
It's not about that.
Can I use your dictionary?
Sure.
Change the tape.
You found that?
The volunteers
leave those things...
What?
What do you do
when you watch this?
What?
You gonna make me say?
So that's not affected by MD?
That's a bold question, Misaki!
The little guy works with tissue,
so my disease doesn't affect him.
Really.
Mitani is running late.
Could you stay
until he gets here?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Thanks! See you tomorrow.
- Have a good time at work!
- Thanks.
See you.
Bye.
Sorry for the strange question.
Misaki.
Hey. Why did you ask?
Why?
I'll change the tape.
If I were a normal guy,
I'd be holding you now, right?
It's pouring! I'm soaked.
I'll go now.
Misaki...
probably isn't coming back.
What happened?
If no one had come,
she would have
gotten in bed with me.
- See you.
- Bye.
Misaki said she can't come.
Oh.
Oh well.
Go pick up your kid.
But I can't leave you alone.
I'm fine. It'll just be a moment.
Your darling daughter is waiting.
Go ahead.
Alright. I'll hurry.
Thanks!
- Hey!
- We're back...
Shikano!
- Are you OK?
- I fell.
Shikano! Shikano!
Shikano! Shikano!
Shikano!
Misaki!
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
Misaki...
Yes?
I'm...
not gonna make it.
I have...
one last request.
Yes.
Anything.
Your boobs.
Let me touch them.
What?
This is the first time something
good happened in a hospital!
Misaki came back!
Come on!
I was really worried!
Don't joke around like that!
No point in worrying.
Three years ago
we thought it was over.
Heart failure
caused fluid retention.
If he didn't pee by morning,
he was done.
We even talked about his funeral.
Then suddenly he peed like crazy!
He's an immortal legend!
- Tsukada, get my glasses.
- Ok.
OK
Hey, after I get out,
let's go to karaoke.
I'm not going!
Let's go!
You're awful!
She's angry.
Doctor.
Doctor, I'm fine.
I want to go home.
I'm sorry, but you can't.
Why?
Your CO2 levels are too high.
Your lung muscles are weak.
Isn't breathing hard now?
We'll need to put you on a ventilator.
A ventilator?
He needs a tracheotomy?
What will happen then?
It'll take the load off his heart
and make breathing easier.
You'll be connected
to a big machine,
so your movement will be limited.
Like a dog on a leash?
Won't that close his vocal cords?
So he can't talk?
He'll have to accept that.
No!
No ventilator!
Can't we choose the treatment
the patient wants?
NPPV
We can do NPPV, right?
That way he just puts on a mask
to help him breathe.
We can't admit him.
Why?
His primary doctor knows best.
If we treat differently,
it's not fair to Dr. Nohara.
Then I'll explain it
to her carefully.
Hisashi, listen to me.
Doctors must take all factors
into consideration.
Is it proper to do everything
the patient wants?
But what he wants is his life!
His voice is the only weapon
he has to live.
Please don't take his freedom.
Thanks,
Tanaka.
It's a long road ahead.
Was everything OK?
With your dad?
You were worried
things weren't going well.
But this was the first time
he accepted my opinion.
Really.
Thanks to me!
Yeah.
I'm putting the mask on.
It's ready.
- Let's start.
- Yes.
Take it off.
- Take it off.
- Yes.
Doctor.
It hurts.
It'll take time to get used to
the airflow from the machine.
Everyone's different.
Let's keep trying.
Shikano.
Here we go.
Which one do you want?
This one? OK!
I'll ask the doctor.
Thank you.
""English test""
I'm sorry. They said
you can't leave this weekend.
What do you mean?
Just one day!
You mean I can't take the test?
Every day is vital for me.
Next time
who knows how I'll be?
Look. I can't knock the cup over.
Soon
I won't be able to hold a pencil.
If you're telling me
to give up on taking the test
and going to America...
- Takamura?
- I never said that!
- Tanaka.
- Why did you let him leave?
He wanted to take it!
Why didn't you tell me?!
What's wrong?
His condition worsened.
Back to the hospital!
We contacted Nishiku Hospital.
Why Dr. Nohara
and not my father?!
He says he can't go back there.
Tanaka...
I'm here.
What is it?
I...
love...
you.
What are you gonna do?
No!
I can't lose my voice.
You're gonna die!
Help!
Help me!
""Surgery in progress""
After all this,
I couldn't help him.
What happens next
is what matters.
I'm so sorry.
- Mrs. Shikano!
- Mr. Shikano.
I'm his father. Thank you
all for taking care of him.
Hello.
Have a seat.
Please have a seat.
Sorry.
Yasuaki will be fine.
This isn't enough
to make him give in.
Look.
He was a great runner as a kid.
But from age 6,
he started tripping and falling.
- Stand up!
- Stupid!
Klutz!
Be a man and
give it back to them!
914
At 12 he was diagnosed with MD.
Yasuaki,
let's die together.
Shut up!
The doctor said I'd get better!
I'm not dying!
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Well, at least he survived this.
I'll be going now.
You're leaving?
If I stay we'll just fight.
But you should stay,
at least for today.
Hey!
Yasuaki, how do you feel?
You OK?
I get it. You want us to leave.
Mother...mother...
Mother? Mother!
Mother!
Yasuaki? What is it?
When using a ventilator,
phlegm builds up
in the trachea and lungs.
If we don't suck it out,
he'll suffocate.
I'm putting it in now.
Air will come through the cuff.
We put air through the cuff to
keep saliva out of the trachea.
941
The nurses are on call
24 hours for suctioning.
I'm leaving now.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
OK
""I want to go to karaoke""
OK
Karaoke?
Feel better now?
Oh my!
This must be hard.
No, it's not so bad.
What is it?
...
It's upside down!
Tsukada!
Miso?
This is soy sauce ramen.
I wanted miso ramen.
They were out of miso.
Too bad.
Can't you let me sleep?!
I haven't slept at all!
Water.
I'm sorry.
Shikano! Look!
There's a patient
with a ventilator
who adjusted
the airflow in the cuff
and was able to talk!
What's this?
Where'd you get this?
The girls at the cafe set up
a mixer with doctors.
I see!
- You adjust the airflow.
- That's it.
But this person just happened
to make it work.
Will it work for everyone?
What if something happens?
I...want...to...try.
You want to try?
Then we won't tell the nurses.
No way! We can't do that.
We'll take it
from the first marker.
Here we go.
Does it hurt?
Stop! The nurse is coming.
I'll restore the airflow.
Hello.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Is something wrong?
Now we'll try it
from the second marker.
What's that?
We heard that removing air
will let him talk.
Here we go.
Shikano, are you OK?
Don't take any risks.
What are you thinking?
Shikano is amazing.
Yeah.
I think he's getting stronger.
Stronger than I am.
I couldn't live like that.
Me neither.
Say...
I may quit med school.
Why?
Someone as unsure as I am
shouldn't be a doctor.
Why?
What?
Why?
I just don't have the confidence.
This isn't for me.
But...
I've been thinking I wish I had
a doctor as kind as you.
But really...
I'm not kind.
- Just pretending.
- You are kind!
No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- But...
All I think is bad things.
I'm a hypocrite.
Hey, Shikano told me.
About what?
What?
You almost slept with him?
What?
He told me. What does that mean?
Oh...It wasn't that...
You'll do anything out of pity?
Is that it?
What?
What?
But maybe it's not pity.
I may really love him.
You don't get it.
Sorry.
Whatever!
Good morning.
Good morning?
Morning.
Good morning.
Morning.
No way!
I did it.
You can talk!
Yay! You did it!
That hurts!
Sorry!
It's a good hurt.
I'm happy too. So happy.
My boobs. You wanted to
touch them, right?
You're amazing!
This is wonderful!
Great!
He gets his way.
But at least
nothing bad happened.
Doctor. I want to go home.
No! If phlegm
builds up, you'll die.
1056
We're sorry, but our nurses can't
stay at home with you all day.
I have volunteers.
That's right. We can do it.
Suctioning is a procedure
only doctors and nurses can do.
Family is the only exception.
Doctor...
My volunteers are my family.
Even if I died in their care,
I'd have no complaints.
No matter what you say,
you can't leave.
If I'm stuck in this hospital,
I'm not myself!
I won't die counting holes
in the ceiling!
You go home after work.
So I want to go home too.
It's not that simple.
Suctioning requires training.
1074
You need someone all day.
Those people can't do it!
Yes, we can.
Don't talk down to us.
We need volunteers!
Looking for home help volunteers!
We need as many as we can get.
Could you help?
Just give us a little time.
Today's guest is Mr. Tsukada,
an independent
living support volunteer.
The rockin' MD patient
Shikano needs your help!
Thank you.
Please sit anywhere.
Volunteer trainees,
enter this way.
Please come in.
Misaki!
- We're here!
- Thank you!
Where should we sit?
- In front.
- Really?
- Let's go!
- No.
Slowly insert...
the tube.
The most important thing is
to have a strong awareness that
you're responsible for his life.
That concludes the explanation.
Now let's try suctioning.
Thanks, Shikano.
It's scary!
- Oh no!
- It's OK.
You're fine.
Here we go.
Oh! I'm so sorry!
- Go!
- Do it slowly.
Here I go.
- It's OK.
- Now.
Slowly.
Turn it.
Turn and go slowly.
Like that.
Come anytime
if something happens.
I won't come back.
I've finally broken free.
You have quite a family.
Thank you.
I was able to live
independently again,
thanks to my ""Shikano family"".
I see. Thank you.
Make me look good in the article.
Take a good picture.
Here we go.
One more.
Smile.
Hello?
Tanaka? Where have you been?
I was worried about you.
Tanaka?
Thank you. We'll let you know
the publication date.
Come again.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.
Make the photo big!
Shikano.
Tanaka is quitting.
What?
Tanaka. Long time no see.
Wait.
I'm having a recovery party.
I can't go. I quit volunteering.
Misaki told me.
You're quitting med school too?
Remember when you
started volunteering?
You proudly told me,
""I'm here because""
""I want to be a doctor
who can face patients.""
""I want to be a doctor""
""who can care for every patient.""
I knew nothing then.
I thought I could do more.
But I was wrong.
Life is also hard
for healthy people.
What do you want to do?
What's important to you?
I don't know...
You can talk to me
about anything.
After all, we're friends.
Are we?
I think so.
Say anything.
I have nothing to say.
Speak your mind.
Are you being honest with yourself?
Is being honest
such a good thing?
You're proud of your honesty.
But what does it mean?
You try being pushed around.
Thanks for everything.
""Yasuaki Shikano
Recovery Party!""
Thanks to the ventilator,
I'm breathing splendidly.
The ventilator has become
a part of my body.
Ventilators rock!
That's how I feel.
You should try one sometime!
Now my goal is to tell the world
that you can still
have a bright future
even with a ventilator.
He hated it at first.
He's unpredictable.
1181
Twelve years ago,
when I started
living independently,
every day with my volunteers
was a battle.
We butted heads.
We fought many times.
We hurt each other.
But because we were
so honest with each other,
I came to understand you
and you have come
to understand me.
The fact that I'm alive today
is because,
through wind, rain and snow,
every day.
every second,
you were by my side.
I'm so glad
I met
all of you.
Truly.
Truly.
Thank you.
Wonderful, Shikano!
And so that from here on,
Shikano will continue
to be healthy and
incredibly selfish towards us all!
Let's toast!
Shikano,
we thank you.
Cheers!
What's this?
Misaki.
Yes?
Here.
It's a cheap ring,
but my heart is in it.
Will you accept?
What? In front of everyone?
It's because every day
I'm living in everyone's view.
It's impossible to propose alone.
My wish at New Year's was you.
I love you.
I want to
be with you forever.
I'm sorry.
Shikano, you're...
important to me
and a big part of my life.
But I can't accept this.
I...
um...
I like someone.
He's been through a lot.
He gave up on his dreams.
There's nothing between us now.
But...
I'm still attracted to him. And...
I'm frustrated.
So...
I'm sorry.
But thank you.
Have you changed your mind
about quitting school?
That's a shame.
Help me up, please.
Sure.
I'll take this off.
3, 2, 1.
Here.
Ok.
Thank you for your help.
""Getting help
to do what he can't""
""Don't give up on dreams""
What do you want to do?
What's important to you?
Stretch out the wrinkles.
They hurt his skin.
Thanks for teaching me.
Something's strange lately.
He naps a lot. He's more mellow.
It's like he's achieved enlightenment.
Say...
Dr. Nohara said,
""While he can,""
""let him do everything he wants.""
Those were her words.
I love to travel!
Isn't this great!
We're not here for fun, OK?
That sheep looks delicious.
It does.
This feels great.
Wonderful.
Isn't this beautiful?
Yeah!
Wow.
This is lavender ice cream.
And this is milk.
This is the ultimate mix!
There's craft beer, too.
I want some!
He was so happy as soon as
we planned this trip.
His tests were good too.
Yeah. It's all in the mind.
I wish Misaki could have come.
Enjoy.
Misaki?
Yes.
- Phone call.
- Ok.
Misaki!
Thank you.
I'm glad you could both come.
What is this?!
I thought you were dying!
Stop screwing around!
This isn't a joke!
Tanaka, are you crying?
No, I'm not!
I'm just angry.
Please!
I'm so sorry! Really.
He fooled us all too!
He's awful.
I fell over with
the intention of dying.
That was some great acting!
I really thought you were gone.
He really wanted you two
to get back together. Forgive him!
Misaki!
Don't touch me!
Sorry!
I'm so happy
you both are here.
You're gonna
volunteer again, right?
- What?
- What?
Anyway, let's drink!
- Right.
- Let's!
Let's drink!
OK, let's do it!
Tanaka, will you make a toast?
You make the best toasts.
OK.
To the revived Shikano.
Cheers!
Why didn't you tell me?
""Misaki is my girlfriend.""
Don't carry that
tough-guy act too far!
There are more things people
can't do than things they can.
I hate it when you do that.
I hate it!
Don't say it twice.
Sorry.
I'd hate myself
if I had to meet me.
Misaki hates me too.
You don't get it.
What?
Wake up and realize
her feelings for you!
What?
Looks like fun.
What are you talking about?
- It's secrets between men.
- Yes!
That's not fair.
By the way...
That newspaper article
got us new volunteers.
Lots of cute university students.
Don't be jealous.
I may be.
Shikano...
I too
will try being true to myself.
I'm going back to med school.
Really?
I don't want to
disappoint myself.
And I can't fail you.
OK.
I'll let you examine me.
Give me a break!
You never listen to doctors.
Are you running away
from your patient?
You run away from hospitals!
You're right.
Misaki, do your best on the exam.
OK.
You'll be a wonderful teacher.
Thanks.
And, Tanaka, you're the one
who brought Misaki to me.
Thanks to you,
I had fun.
Really.
A lot happened
in this year.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Amazing.
- Beautiful.
Look at me! I'm getting better!
I bet I could run!
""Seven years later""
""To mother""
""Dear mother,""
""I want you to""
""live your life.""
""Don't work too hard.""
""You loved me so much it hurt.""
""I'm sorry I turned you away.""
""But that was how I wanted to live.""
""Love,
Your stupid son.""
I'm so sorry.
My old man hates hospitals.
It's OK. Some patients
prefer to be at home.
Do you have more patients
after this?
I have to work hard
or I'll be scolded.
By whom?
Above the clouds,
someone annoying is watching.
Teacher's here!
How are you?
We're great!
What will we sing today?
Today
a song from my past.
What is it?
""Ms. Misaki
Congratulations on your marriage""
""How far will we go tonight?""
""Will we stay here forever?""
""I'm gonna explode""
""Being alive is too wonderful""
""I want you to kiss me""
""So we can get closer to our dreams""
""I want you to kiss me""

You got it?
It's okay, it's okay.
Hey.
Everything's okay.
Come here, gorgeous,
let's lay you down.
Jason!
Jason, Jason, shit, no!
God, God, what have you done?
Shit! Fuck!
Mom?
- Aaah.
- A little bit wider.
- Aaah.
- Okay, good.
Let me just clean these a bit.
That's it.
And done.
All right, Isabelle,
you're all done for today.
Mom!
All good. Good?
Everyone can see from the
science corridor and everything.
Why would you say that?
No, it was so hot.
I just think it's important
for you to know.
Oh, that's very helpful.
Thank you.
I'm so embarrassed.
Right, where are
we gonna put these letters?
Um, I actually think
they could be nice
just, like, in the middle
just so it's...
I don't know, I think...
I think that's a lot.
Like, it's just a lot going on
if it's in the middle.
Do you know what I mean?
Oh, my God, Max just put
our campaign in his story.
But isn't that
kind of the point, though,
just to get attention
and raise money?
I don't know,
I think if you just...
if you move them
to the bottom.
- Like, move all of them...
- Yes, like that?
- Yeah, it's not so on the nose, like it's just...
- Mm.
- What do you think, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, that works as well.
- Mm.
- What are you guys wearing tomorrow?
- I'm wearing this really nice jean jacket.
- Is it big?
Yeah,
it's really nice and fun.
- It's really nice.
- I'm gonna wear...
Guys, you don't understand
how bad these butt patches were.
I'm not joking...
I'm gonna wear my green skirt
and then maybe your gray jumper?
Isabelle!
- Isabelle, can you move your shoes?
- In a minute!
- I feel like not enough people saw enough.
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm gonna wear your gray jumper.
- That's cool.
That goes well together.
That's really nice.
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Oh, God!
It's just another
flagrant guilt trip
about her poor
thumb-sucking gums.
I mean, the only brace that she
would even begin to consider
is some invisible thing.
I mean, it's just gonna
burn through our savings.
Oh, dear.
Hey.
I got one more thing for you.
Take one of these.
- Okay, see you next week.
- Thank you.
Betsey Hughes?
- Hi, Betsey.
- Hi.
Are you any closer
to narrowing down your options?
Um, well, I'm...
I'm just still thinking.
Your highest grades
are across the sciences.
You were leaning that way
before, weren't you?
Yeah, I just...
I'm not really sure science
is my thing anymore.
I see that you've taken
some time out from school,
and that may mean
that it will take you
a little bit longer
to come to a decision.
Have you considered a gap year?
Travel, maybe?
I, uh... I don't think my mom
would like that very much.
Well, you've got a couple more
weeks for the extended deadline.
But you need to allow time
for the forms and statement.
Why don't you sign up for
another appointment next week?
And in the meantime,
have a think about
what really interests you.
Maybe start a list.
Hmm!
Hey. Sorry.
Well, you look nice.
- I like your lips.
- Thanks.
Trying something new.
Oh.
Hey.
Yeah, yeah, I'll be right out.
Yeah, okay.
Hey, Dom's waiting for me.
See you later.
Mom?
Mom?
Mom, I'm going now.
Trying to say goodbye.
You okay?
I'm fine, just hiding
from the washing up.
You staying
at Dominic's tonight?
Maybe. I don't know.
I'm not sure yet.
Okay, text me when you know.
- Okay.
- Have fun.
Love you!
I love you back.
Are you all right?
Hmm?
Thanks.
You, uh, wanna try something?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, all right.
Oh!
Fuck, what was that?
- Stop laughing, stop laughing.
- Ugh.
It's just powdered alcohol.
It's just powdered alcohol.
- Are you okay?
- You're an asshole.
I'm sorry.
It was a joke.
You know, they got me too.
- Hey, hey, I'm sorry.
- Uh-uh, it's fine, it's fine.
- I'm going out for a smoke.
- I'm sorry, baby. It was just a bit of fun.
Listen, I'm a victim and all.
- Let's get Adam and that.
- No, let's get Grace.
Grace?
- Yeah.
- Grace.
Dom, can I get a drink?
Um, help yourself.
Let me try yours, mate.
You're the one
that's not been drinking.
Just one sip, bruh.
Come on.
Something light.
Come on, drink,
drink, drink, drink.
What's Betsey doing?
- She's blazed.
- Wait.
How much alcohol
did you put in that condom?
Oh, my God.
Dom. Dom!
Oh, love,
what happened?
Can we please
just go home?
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey!
You feeling better?
I don't know.
My... my skin's all tingly.
Tingling?
Yeah, yeah,
like numb or something.
- How much did you drink?
- It's not that.
Hey, baba.
Don't worry, it's probably
just a little allergic reaction
maybe from, you know,
sulfates or a little bug.
Probably just hung over.
I'm gonna take Izzy
to the rink later.
I don't know... do you want
a lift or do you wanna come?
She'd really like that.
Shit!
So we're going
around in a circle this morning.
And we're gonna go round, yes,
and then try balancing on that one leg.
So we're trying to balance
on our left leg, all right?
Weight over this side.
Okay, keep it up there,
keep your head up.
Yeah, nice little stretch,
just feel it at the back.
Okay, all right.
So now we go into the back, go.
- What, like that?
- Yeah, good.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Mm.
Hold it, that's it.
- All right, go and do it again.
- Oh, hello.
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi.
It's fine.
I could have it worse,
of course.
I don't mean to moan.
What about you?
How are things?
You know, keeping busy.
Where's Betsey applying to uni?
- She doesn't know yet.
- Oh.
Well, it's been a difficult year
for her, poor thing.
For all of you.
It's not just that, though,
you know?
I don't know.
What?
I mean,
it doesn't matter.
- What?
- No, it's nothing, really.
- I... it's silly.
- No, go on. What?
I just wonder what...
the point of it all is,
you know?
I know.
You really have to wonder what's
a degree even worth these days.
And the pressure these girls
are getting from all sides.
You know, with the testing and
all the extracurricular stuff.
I said to Caroline the other
day, ""You need to be careful.
You really need to buckle
down and do some work,
because if you don't,
you'll get left behind.
And trust me...""
It started
about a week ago.
It started
seven days ago.
Sorry, it started
exactly a week ago.
Okay.
And it comes in waves.
That's right, isn't it?
Yeah, it...
it's all over my body sometimes.
Like, my skin just shuts off.
- Shuts off?
- Yeah.
I don't know, it's weird.
Is it happening right now?
Any other symptoms?
Fatigue, muscle ache,
memory issues?
- I haven't really been eating.
- Oh.
I just get nauseous around food
since it started.
Would you mind popping on
to the bed for me, please?
Just leave your coat.
If you could lie down for me.
If you can pull your shirt up for me so
I can just examine your tummy a second.
That's good, just that.
Feel any pain?
No?
Good, you can sit up for me.
So, um, how's down below?
Passing urine, bowel movement,
menstrual cycles?
That's, um... it's all fine.
Are you sexually active?
- That's not the problem.
- Using protection?
We've discussed being safe.
Some stress at home?
- Stress at school?
- No.
It's probably just some viral
thing passing through her system.
But we'll do the bloodwork
just to make sure, okay?
Okay.
- How was it?
- It was a bit weird, but fine.
- Why? What did he do?
- Checked my blood.
What, you had to get a needle?
Yeah, just did that one,
like, in here.
- Ugh.
- I know.
Now it's just more wait,
see now.
Sounds like nothing.
Trust in the doctors, Holly.
They know more than you do.
- Don't do that.
- Do what?
I know what you're doing
and I'm asking you to stop.
Should I come visit?
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?
I can make the time.
Yech,
you know what I mean?
- Hmm?
- No.
- No.
- I'll send some money, then. Get help with the cleaning.
I told you, I don't need that.
I'm fine.
- I'm just trying to be helpful.
- Thank you for offering.
- Get a massage. You're so tense.
- Okay, I have to go now.
- Well, keep me in the loop, darling.
- Bye, Mommy.
- Granny says hi, sends hugs and kisses.
- Hi, Granny.
- You want some bread?
- Mm-mm, no.
Hey, babe.
Do you wanna try
just a tiny little bit?
I'm not hungry.
I thought maybe if we just start
you off with a few simple things...
Mom,
can you pass the...
Mm, yeah.
Thank you.
I don't really know
what to do with you, Bets.
You feel like you need
to do something with me?
I mean do for you.
You know, don't play
with my words, okay?
Hmm.
There.
Five little, tiny, weeny peas.
They're not gonna hurt you.
I said I'm not hungry.
Sweety, you can't
just live on tea.
It's not healthy.
Here.
Mom, I...
she's just been to doctor's.
Maybe she doesn't
have to eat yet.
Like, she doesn't feel well.
Thank you, Izzy.
That's so helpful.
Please.
Betsey, please.
Hmm.
There.
Good, right?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?
Here, have some more.
Bets?
Bets?
Bets!
Izz, call an ambulance!
Isabelle!
Are you calling?
- Quick!
- Yes!
Um, ambulance!
Betsey, come on, breathe!
I'm so sorry!
Um, uh... 1050 Mulligan Street.
- Darling.
- No, she's calming down now. I'm so sorry.
Um, uh, she's just lying
with my mom.
Dr. Foster, please come to surgery.
Dr. Foster,
please come to surgery.
I'd recommend
any of the names on this list
just to explore
some possibilities.
Okay.
Hey, Bets.
Yeah?
We'll figure this out, okay?
- Okay.
- We will, trust me.
What if there isn't anything
to figure out, though?
You're not crazy.
There's something going on,
and we will find out what it is.
- Mom.
- Hmm?
What if this is just me now?
- What do you mean?
- Well, I don't know.
I... I think...
What?
Some people are
just destined for stuff, right?
Like, some people
are just special like that?
This is not your destiny.
Bets, you can be
whatever you want.
You can be anything.
That's it.
I'm gonna go and put these
in your bathroom, okay?
Okay.
I'll get it!
No, I'll go.
- Dominic, hey.
- Hi, Mrs. Hughes.
Look at you!
Your hair!
I know, it's grown, hasn't it?
- I'm so glad you came.
- Yeah, me too, me too.
- You look lovely.
- Oh.
- Oh, she's... she's in her room.
- Thank you, thank you.
Hey.
- Shoes.
- Yep. Sorry.
Bets?
Hey.
Boo.
So, are you dying or something?
Close the door.
Stop, stop it.
No, you stop.
Stop pointing and laughing.
I'm telling you.
- You're lying.
- No, no, obviously.
Oh, hi, Mom.
Hey.
So nice to hear you laugh.
Thanks.
- Mom, Mom, I need to...
- Of course, yeah, sorry.
What?
Can I tell you something?
Are you leaving already?
Yeah.
- You're not hungry?
- No, thank you.
Really nice seeing you.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Just thought I'd give
Isabelle some things.
Hey.
Dominic didn't stay long.
Did you have a fight?
I didn't.
He might have.
Hey.
Hey, come here.
It will get better.
Just wait and see.
You're my special girl, Bets.
Hey.
Hey.
Everything okay?
Yeah, um...
Betsey's gonna give you
some of her clothes.
Supper's in an hour.
Here.
I mean,
I've basically been leading,
like, my whole secondary school
education up until this.
It's not even fair 'cause
kids who are year 11 now
- got to do it last year.
- Hmm?
Apparently, just 'cause
one boy took it too far,
they're not even gonna
let us do it this year.
- Okay, what?
- I said, apparently, just 'cause one boy
took it too far, they're not even
gonna let us do it this year.
- Who told you that?
- Everyone knows, everybody.
- Can you stop waving your spoon around?
- Mom, it's important!
It's tradition.
Betsey got to do it.
Right, Bets?
Bets?
Hmm?
Can we just have a nice supper?
- I'm not hungry.
- Not funny.
I'm not trying to be funny.
Is this because I
stopped your allowance this week?
It's 12 pounds.
Yeah, I'm sure I'll manage.
Maybe she's just not hungry.
Do you know there are families
in the world that have nothing?
They have nothing.
They have to eat cats!
Cats?
It's not funny, Isabelle.
Get up.
- What?
- Don't ""what"" me, get up.
- Get up!
- Mom!
- Eat your food, please.
- You're hurting me!
I have tried
really hard with you.
- I have listened.
- Mom!
- Mom, stop!
- Stay there!
For you, it's one thing,
it's your body.
I... I don't like it,
but it is your body.
But you do not...
you do not infect this family
with your ideas.
- I'm not.
- You are!
Do you think it's funny?
You're laughing at me.
Is this like some little game?
It's not a fucking game, Betsey!
It's a sickness.
You're sick!
I'm not sick.
Okay, people do not
just stop eating.
Do you know
what it's called, hmm?
It's anorexia.
Do you know who gets it?
Entitled, middle-class
white girls.
- I'm not anorexic!
- You wait!
Get on.
Get on.
Will you fucking
get on the scale!?
We are weighing you twice a day.
""Betsey's weight.""
What's the, um...
It's the 17th.
Thank you.
Once in the morning,
once at night.
Twice a day.
- Hey, Granny.
- Hello.
- Hello, darling.
- Hi, Mom.
I'll put this in the kitchen.
- Is she in her room?
- Yeah.
- Here, take a look at this.
- Yeah, she's...
Oh, hi, Granny June.
Hello, you.
What time do you call this?
Were you planning
on sleeping through lunch?
How's your boyfriend?
You mean John,
do you, darling?
John.
Truth is, he bores me.
Mom didn't say you were coming.
Well, I heard you hadn't
been feeling very well,
so I thought I'd visit,
check on you.
- That's nice.
- I thought so.
Do you remember the summer
you stayed with Granddad and me?
Yes, you do.
It was the first time
you and your sister
stayed overnight with us,
remember?
Granddad rented Harry Potter,
thought you'd love it.
- Oh, uh, yeah, maybe.
- Your mother was livid.
You had to sleep in their bed
for weeks after that.
Do you know she threatened never
to leave you with me again?
As if she was doing me a favor,
dropping you terrors off
at my house.
You remember the morning
after Potter-gate, don't you?
I had work to do
and I told you to go and find
something to do outside.
- No, I... I don't remember.
- I do.
Later, I made lunch
and I came out to find you.
That's when I heard you
talking to someone.
Who?
I watched you, Betsey,
for a good, long time.
And you had no idea.
That night, you tried
to get into my bed.
You came through, woke us both,
and said you could hear
something under your own bed.
You were terribly upset,
tears and everything.
Granddad bought it,
hook, line, and sinker,
but I took you back
to your room,
to your own bed, and made you
stay there until you fell asleep.
I don't remember that either.
Then you won't remember rehearsing
the whole thing that morning.
I watched you practice
the routine in the garden.
Word for word.
You had it down to the tears.
It was all a little act
to get what you already knew
you wanted.
I rather admired you.
""What a shrewd little
performer she is,"" I thought.
We've all got problems, darling.
Don't be the show.
Now, get up
and come down for lunch.
So, girls, what we'd like
to do this week
is a diary share,
if you wouldn't mind.
Julia, would you like
to go first?
Um, so, on Wednesday, I went
around the grounds and...
The days will be quite
structured in the early weeks,
but you'll find, with time,
you'll gain freedom
to make more choices.
Please, Betsey,
feel free to look around.
Are there
any restrictions on visits?
Not outside
of the designated therapy hours.
- When are those?
- It varies.
Can we take her out
for special occasions, holidays?
Not without prior consent
from the therapist, no.
I've asked you
really politely.
I would have it on Saturday
when I normally have it.
I'll have it now.
There's something
obviously bothering you.
Fuck you!
Come on, now,
count to 10.
But you don't understand!
It's important...
- Let's go back inside.
- It's the rules. I'm sorry, I can't.
I don't care
about the rules!
- Bets.
- It's the way it is. Just keep calm.
- Betsey, come.
- Stop following me!
Damn it!
They were right in here.
I put them in the shitting bag
so I wouldn't lose them.
Maybe you left them
in the office.
I didn't leave them
in the office.
Maybe you...
Good.
Okay.
- Mom.
- Yeah?
Can we go somewhere
before we go home?
This is where it all started.
I was at the party,
but I was in my head, you know?
I was trying to think
about what really interests me,
the... the future
and where I fit into it.
I tried to imagine
me leaving home,
and Izzy growing up,
and you getting old, but I...
realized I just couldn't
see it.
Thinking about all that stuff
just felt fake.
I came outside for some air
and that's when I felt it.
I felt something calling me.
And it brought me here
and it showed me.
I can feel what's coming for us.
And it's just darkness,
Mom, for everyone.
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't be scared.
I've been chosen.
- Oh, my love.
- What?
I didn't see it before,
but I see now.
- You're unwell.
- I'm not unwell.
It's a blessing.
Well, we'll go back
to the doctor, mm?
And we're gonna tell him
all of this, okay, mm?
There's nothing wrong with me.
We will find you a specialist
that understands.
You know, a psychiatric one, because
what you're doing is very dangerous!
- I'm not losing weight, Mom.
- I know that, but I'm scared, okay?
This isn't something
you have a choice in, Mom.
Neither of us do.
Let's go, come on.
Mom.
Mom, if you don't support me,
I'll have to leave.
I will have you sectioned
before I let you leave.
- No, you won't.
- I will.
- But you won't.
- I fucking will, Betsey!
If you did that, I'd kill myself.
Haven't you ever wondered
what the point of everything is?
You have to trust me, okay?
How can you know this?
It's like there was
a hollow in me before, and...
now it's been filled.
I feel it.
It's faith.
It's been especially
challenging this year,
so I'm looking for some help.
I appreciate your concern,
but I am asking
to withdraw the funds.
Sir, I'm at my last resort.
All of it.
I need to withdraw all of it.
So, how much is the fee?
Thank you.
Um, thank you very much
for your help.
Can we leave?
Oh, hey.
How was it,
being back on the ice?
Don't think I wanna
do it anymore.
Oh, Granny's there.
- Hey, Granny.
- Hello.
How long
have you been outside?
Ages.
I didn't know you were coming.
Lovely to see you two.
Izzy, can you go
and check on Betsey, please?
Do as your mother
bids you, Isabelle.
Are you thirsty?
Yeah, sure.
I'm surprised
you didn't call ahead.
I've called many times.
You don't answer
the phone, Holly.
Are you hungry?
I could make some hummus.
I thought you couldn't
leave her alone now.
It's fine.
She's in a dormant phase.
I see, mm-hmm.
A dormant phase.
There are other rehab solutions
to consider.
Internationally renowned
institutions.
Doesn't have to be in the UK.
You know money isn't an issue.
Mmm, I'm not sending her
away, Mom.
Okay.
But she does need
professional care.
Her GP checks on her weekly.
And she has seen
every specialist under the sun.
Don't exaggerate.
Oh, for God's sake, Holly.
Bets?
Do you remember
that year we had in Osaka
when I was teaching?
You were six, I think.
You gonna tell me a story, Mom?
I was studying folklore.
I remember being very caught up
in comparative oral histories.
It was a big thing back then,
wonderful stories.
Living stories.
There's this particular one
that keeps coming back to me,
with Betsey being as she is.
The Futakuchi-Onna.
It's a ghost tale, really.
A very old one.
A poor farmer marries
a beautiful young woman.
The woman, of course,
represents the ideal Japanese wife.
Courteous, obedient, quiet.
Perfect in every way
except for one thing.
She ever eats.
Not a single grain of rice
enters her mouth.
So this begins to gnaw
at the farmer.
The mystery of it
is hard for him to ignore.
But what's worse is that
his reserves are being depleted.
It's as if he were feeding two
instead of just himself.
So one day, this peasant farmer
plots to stay back
from his fields
to spy on his new bride.
He does this and discovers
the Futakuchi-Onna
dining on his reserves,
living on the back
of his precious bride's head.
A grotesque mouth
hidden among her braided hair.
Are you suggesting
Betsey's been possessed
by a demon?
Quite the opposite, Holly.
I believe Betsey's
possessed this family.
You most of all.
Mom!
Izzy?
Okay Izzy, I'm coming!
- Mom!
- I... I'm coming!
Mom!
Hey!
Oh, move.
Go! Go, go, go.
Bets?
Bets?
Baby?
Honey, I'm here.
Sometimes it's like...
it's like she's completely gone.
- Voices.
- More like she taps out.
She'll say those things and...
she comes up
with really dark stuff.
Like what?
Like talk about end of times
or ideas of what she thinks
is coming.
She says she has to prepare.
She has to serve or whatever.
It's why she won't eat.
That's her part in it all.
She does this really scary thing
where she stops breathing
and the temperature drops and she's...
she's like an icicle.
What does the doctor
say about that?
Who are you talking to?
Someone used to
come once a week,
but Betsey made them stop.
She said they, like,
get in the way of her work.
- This is utterly ridiculous.
- No, no, no, no.
No, no.
Just sit down.
- Holly, what happened?
- It was sort of a... a fit.
- Honey, does it hurt?
- Well, of course it hurts.
- Look at her.
- It's fine. Don't worry.
It was an accident.
It was an accident.
I fell on the ice.
You're lucky
you didn't break your nose.
First top and lower incisors
are fine,
but without the brace,
her cross bite has advanced,
as predicted.
It's not causing her
any pain, though, is it?
Any headaches?
- Neck aches?
- No.
Well, we just have to keep
an eye on the crowding.
When am I gonna see big sister?
She's overdue.
Yeah, I must get her in.
- Uh, Holly.
- Yes?
Is everything okay?
Yes, fine, fine.
I wonder,
would you like to review
your payment plan?
Your last two months
are outstanding
and with Betsey
missing appointments...
I am so sorry.
I had this issue
with online banking.
And I just...
I will sort it out this afternoon.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Of course.
How was it?
Yeah, it was fine.
God, stop! What've you done?
What are you doing?
Betsey!
Take your hands off.
No, no, no, darling.
Darling, breathe, please.
Izzy!
Izzy, help! Izzy!
God, please help me!
Don't! Stop! Darling.
No, no, no!
- Mom?
- Izzy, help me!
Mom what's she doing
to herself?
You were supposed to watch her!
Betsey, just breathe, breathe.
I see the stars.
And what else?
The stars.
They pour out of eyes and
mouths, and they burn it all.
What do they burn?
Everything.
It's inside all of us.
Stars.
Light.
Purpose.
I can feel it.
I can feel it, I can feel it,
I can feel it, I can feel it.
- I can feel the end.
- Go on.
And then what?
Dark!
Darling.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, it's okay.
It's okay.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey.
Betsey.
Where's all this coming from?
- Hi, Gran.
- Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
Oh, Bets.
Tell us what's wrong.
Don't worry, Granny.
This'll all be over really soon.
When, Betsey?
There's still time.
Mom's still searching for it.
I want you all to know
this hope.
This feeling.
Dad says that he's sorry.
What?
What... what did you say?
- Betsey, how...
- There's no time.
Betsey, no,
what did you just say?
Betsey, Betsey, please, please.
Did you just say...
Holly, surely you can see
this is getting
seriously out of control.
I'm worried about both of you.
You're a mess.
Isabelle's a nervous wreck
and Betsey's all...
Betsey's what?
She's disturbed.
I mean, I can see
she's convinced herself
of this fiction, but you're...
What am I?
You're going along with it.
It's time we get you both help.
I don't want your kind of help.
What does that mean?
I don't want to send
my daughter away to get fixed.
To get pumped full of lithium
till all the lights go out.
With not one visit.
You were very ill.
I did what was recommended.
I did my very best.
Well, it wasn't good enough!
I want you to go.
I don't want you here.
Please tell Isabelle
she's welcome
to come and stay with me
if she needs a break.
Bets?
Bets?
Betsey, what is this?
Ew!
Bets?
- So, your sister.
- Hmm?
Does she, like,
fucking walk around
with her eyes shut or some shit?
- No.
- Well, she's like a sorcerer, isn't she?
No.
A sorcerer is like
an old guy with a beard
off Game Of Thrones
or some shit, you dickhead.
Fuck off.
Dom dated her.
He said she thinks
she's some sort of...
fucking prophet or some shit.
Does Dom still text her?
- Izzy.
- Hmm?
Here.
Suck it like a straw.
No, you gotta do it again
if you wanna get high.
- Come on, one more set. Come on, come on!
- Yeah, yeah.
Yes!
- Yes! Finally, finally.
- Took your time, though.
- Hey.
- Hi.
My shoes.
- Is it your girlfriend?
- No.
It's Dom.
The fuck are you doing?
Are you stupid, Caleb?
Get up.
Are you all right?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You sure?
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
take you home, okay?
What?
Are you gonna...
It's all right, it's all right.
Just let it out.
There we go.
You okay?
Oh, Mrs. Hughes,
I am so sorry.
I had no idea Caleb had alcohol.
I know that's not
a good enough excuse, but...
ah, he's just a cheeky shit.
What did she say to you?
What, Izzy?
No, no.
Betsey.
Right, you were here
and then you left.
We haven't seen you.
Oh.
What did she say to you?
Shit.
Dominic, sit down.
You know, she just... she just
told me that she wasn't eating.
That she didn't want to.
And then she just said she
wasn't coming back to school.
And then she told me
what happens in the end,
Mrs. Hughes, about the stars,
and how we need to reset.
She told me the reason
she's been chosen
is because you're the first star
and she has to prepare you.
Do you pray, Dominic?
Yes, Mrs. Hughes.
Does it work?
I don't think
that's the point, Mrs. Hughes.
Eat.
Oh, God, please, wake up.
Wake up. Wake up!
We need your help!
Wake up!
Just, please, just...
Betsey, please!
Please, please!
You need to wake up, please!
Please, please, just eat it.
Please!
Izzy, stop!
Mom, I'm scared.
I am so scared
of what's gonna happen next.
Izzy, no, you stop that!
- Please, just eat it.
- Izzy.
- Please! Oh, please.
- Shush.
Shush, now.
It's okay.
Get off me. Get...
Get off.
This is so fucked up!
Mom?
Hey.
Hey, babba.
It's just for the weekend.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I love you so much.
She's your special girl, right?
What? No, no.
Yeah, thing is, um,
I mean, if she's right,
like, you know, this,
me, you, Dad, Gran,
you know, it's... it's nothing.
I mean, everything is just
meaningless if it goes away.
- No, you mustn't think that.
- She's lying, then.
I don't know.
But either way, she showed me.
What, what?
What did she show you?
Showed me what it's like
to be nothing.
Gran, I'm gonna play outside.
Darling?
Don't worry, she'll be fine.
I wanted to apologize.
They're your daughters
and I know how much
you love them.
You're a very good mother.
I was just pregnant
when we decided to buy this
house, and we walked in here
and he said,
""This is Betsey's room.""
And if he were here now,
then he would know what to do.
He was so bloody confident.
It was so good because it
meant I didn't have to be.
I could just be me.
I didn't have to pretend
to hold it all together.
I don't want to pretend
to be that person anymore.
I just want it all to be over.
I don't want to be in control.
I just...
I just want to let go
of everything.
It's in a week.
A... a new world for all of us.
A new way of life,
a fresh start.
But the heat will consume
everything
and the stars will burn it all so
that our work can finally start again.
It's okay, it's okay.
You don't have to be scared.
You don't have to be afraid,
because I've seen what happens afterwards.
It's so beautiful.
So beautiful.
I'm gonna need you, Mom.
Okay, I'll need you.
I've seen now
what it's gonna be.
I'm gonna need you
to help me, okay?
That's your purpose.
That's what I've seen for you.
That's why you're my mom.
Your love is key
to all of this, okay?
Do you understand?
And I know that you've suffered.
And I know that Isabelle has
too, and I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I can't wait for you to see
what comes after this
because then you can finally
know that it's all worth it.
Okay? Then you can
finally believe me.
But I need you to promise,
Mom, okay?
I need you to promise
because I'm gonna say things.
And I'm gonna be really,
really tempted to give up,
but you can't let me, okay?
You have to be strong.
- I will try.
- No. You have...
You have... you have to promise.
- You have to promise.
- I promise.
Really, really promise?
I do, I do, I promise you.
Why are you doing this to me?
Why, Mom, are you
doing this to me?
- Stop it!
- Oh, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts!
No, you are strong, baby.
I lied, I lied, I lied, I lied!
- No, love, be strong!
- Mommy, please! Yes!
No, I need an ambulance!
I need a fucking ambulance!
Mom, I need help, I need help, I need help!
Please? God, Jesus.
- I need help!
- Jesus Christ.
Stop it! Stop it!
No, I'm not strong enough.
I am not... no, I can't do it.
- They said... you said it would come to this.
- I lied.
Mom, it hurts, it hurts it hurts!
- Please let me go!
- Baby, I can't!
- Please help me!
- Baby, you can do it.
Get me a fucking ambulance!
Fuck you!
Stay with me!
Mom.
Mom?
Hey, it's okay.
You can if you want.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I know you love me.
No.
No, I believe you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Don't be sorry.
Don't be sorry, don't be sorry.
No, I'm sorry that I hurt you.
You didn't hurt me.
You made me strong.
I liked being special.
You've always been special.
You're amazing.
You did this, you know?
Your love made all of this
possible.

9,A Barefoot Dream (2010) - full transcript,"After a series of pipe dream ventures go belly up, retired pro soccer player Kim Won-kang happens to visit East Timor, where he finds children playing the game barefoot on rocky pitches. Sensing a new business opportunity on finding the country doesn't have a single sporting goods store, he embarks on a scheme to get rich quick by purveying athletic shoes to the unshod youngsters. Sadly, no one there can afford to pay $60 for a pair of shoes, even on a generous installment plan, and before he knows it, he is reduced to coaching a team of ragged 10-year-olds and prospects are looking grim.","(Portugal colonized East Timor...)
(for 450 years.
Indonesia's armed forces...)
(caused the death of about
60,000 people. And during...)
(the 24 year occupation,
200,000 people died.)
(In 1999, Indonesia surrendered
and pulled out.)
(But due to pro-Indonesia militia
that opposed independence, )
(thousands died and tens
of thousands became displaced.)
(In 2002, East Timor
finally became independent.)
(But the conflict
in the east and west...)
(still remains a cause
for societal conflict.)
(This movie is based on children
from East Timor...)
(and a Korean soccer coach.)
(It is based on
a miracle-like true story.)
(2003 Sumatra, Indonesia)
This is crazy.
The hail is pounding down...
like crazy.
Korea can't even compare to this.
Jungles are like that.
They are very dangerous places.
Getting bitten by
a snake could kill you.
Getting bitten by a crocodile too.
We don't need to worry.
We have a gun.
Don't be so frightened.
Whatever you say,
the crocodiles are all mine.
Just go, go, go.
It's raining.
It's going to rain soon.
If you continue, this is the
express route to the afterlife.
I got it so just keep going, man.
To make money, you have to work
when others aren't working.
Go. Go, go.
Crocodile hunting, go, go.
You're jerk...
How could you run and
leave me here?
Come on, come out!
The money I lost from timber,
I'll make it back with crocodiles.
I must...
make ramen.
Hot!
(A Barefoot Dream)
(Indonesia Medan Hospital)
I feel like death.
I got burned, I have malaria,
it's crazy.
Hey.
But if I don't leave,
the debt collectors will kill me.
Who? Shin, what?
Shin Young-hoon?
Woo-seok should take
responsibility for that.
(Ko Chang-seok)
Yeah, but...
Come on.
I'm your little brother...
Hello? Sister?
Don't hang up. Hello...
(Shin Cheol-Jin,
Yong-go Do, Joseph)
I didn't,
didn't get to talk to her.
The call got disconnected...
(Guest appearance/lm Won-hee,
Kim Seo-hyung, Cho Jin-woong)
Go away, go away.
Go away.
Mr. Kim Won-gwang.
Hello.
You know me?
It was around '83...
The Qatar youth?
You slipped during the
preliminaries so it didn't count.
There were a lot
of rising stars in that team.
You worked in soccer?
No, but...
I saw you a few times when I
was on the Hyundai Motor Co. team.
Although you don't
know me very well.
I'm Yoo Bo-hyun with Yonhap News.
Yes, I'm Kim Won-gwang...
I told you I know you.
You're quite famous.
I'm not famous...
- Soccer isn't really...
- The news about a Korean...
almost dying while in
the jungle in Sumatra.
All the Koreans in Indonesia
know about it.
You don't have anything
better to put on the news?
So I said, that money...
I quit so I could earn money.
There's nothing I haven't tried.
But it's all a failure.
So miss, I quit soccer.
But that's all I knew how to do.
How could I earn money?
How could I earn money?
Is money stupid?
- So what are you going to do?
- Just wait.
I'm not done talking yet.
So I got a loan.
- You got a loan.
- Yes.
And opened a factory in Indonesia.
But got conned and
lost everything.
How did you know?
You already told me earlier.
Really?
So what are you going to do now?
So what should I do?
But...
What are they doing there?
Oh, have you...
heard about East Timor?
East Timor? What's that?
The first nation to become
independent in the 21st century.
They don't have anything,
so it's just the start.
That's not right...
It's just the start,
so they have nothing?
(Dili, East Timor)
But still, one thing remains.
Hope?
Very hopeful.
Where's the car?
- I'm OK.
- Where's the car?
- I don't have a car.
- Where's the car?
Get out of the way.
Thanks but...
to a child...
That's a bit harsh...
Hey, are you OK?
Are you OK?
Hey, Mr. Kim.
- You...
- Yes, I'm James.
- James?
- Yes, I'm James.
Show me.
Show me.
- You?
- Yes, I'm James.
- James.
- Different.
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to East Timor.
Get in the car,
get in the car, OK?
Hey, hey, hey.
Get away from my car!
Get away from my car, OK?
- One dollar, one dollar.
- No, no.
One dollar mister, one dollar.
Get off, OK?
One dollar.
One dollar mister, one dollar.
Mister, one dollar.
One dollar mister.
Darn.
(Ramos)
Hey.
The UN will give them money soon.
Once they get the money,
there's going to be a lot to do.
We got to build houses,
and new roads.
We have to build factories.
There's going to be
so much happening, OK?
I'm so glad to be working
with a fellow Korean.
- Take it.
- OK.
The quality of coffee
here is excellent.
Good.
Hey...
We're going to be rich soon.
Rich soon?
Yes, very rich.
You really do have a vision.
- A vision?
- Yeah.
Is the coffee mountain near?
No.
You just rest today, OK?
Tomorrow, your life
will change forever.
- Change.
- You, smell money.
Money smell, oh yeah, yeah.
Hey, James.
It's been a long time.
How are you doing, Mr. Park?
The UN is searching
high and low for you.
Get the heck out of here?
Want me to give them a call?
Who is it, James?
Why did you have to hit my head?
I'll go, I'll go.
James...
- See you.
- See you!
James...
Was he talking about coffee again?
His repertoire never changes.
I apologize.
My name is Park In-gi.
I work at the Korean consulate.
Did you arrive today?
The coffee construction...
There's not much you can do here.
The Koreans who come here
are one of two types.
People who get conned by
people like James.
Or people who come
here to con others.
You should just return.
There's really nothing here.
What a fuss.
Hello.
You're checking out?
You can go in my car.
It's OK, there are
a lot of taxis around.
Come now,
I said it's fine.
I'll take you to the airport.
Let's go.
I can get there on my own,
you know.
Are you afraid I won't leave?
It's not that.
It may not seem like it,
but it's a bit dangerous here.
There are sometimes gunfights.
And bombs.
Protecting a fellow countryman,
in this dangerous place is...
our duty.
Um...
Sorry.
That little guy...
(Ddua)
Where are you going?
Ramos! Ramos!
Not bad.
You don't even know
how to play soccer.
Do you want to die!
I'll kill Ramos.
You be careful.
What are you doing? Let's go!
I'm not leaving.
It doesn't matter what you do.
It won't work.
60 dollars? Crazy...
Mr. Kim, that's only
$6 in Dongdaemun Gate.
Hey, it's Nike.
And this is all fake.
- Fake?
- Fake?
All the tags are here.
How hard could it be to make them?
You saw that the kids play soccer
every chance they get, right?
The balls will deflate someday.
And their shoes will
get worn down, too.
This is really...
a business plan that can't fail.
So why doesn't East Timor
have a sports store?
That's why this is
called a monopoly.
Got it? Put it there.
Let's take a photo, Mr. Consul.
So I can hang it right here.
Let's see.
Yes, stand right there.
In-gi, stand there. Hey Major.
Please take a photo for us.
So that we can see the sign.
Korean Sports.
Welcome.
Welcome.
These shoes...
Great choice.
Sixty dollars.
Special sale, 35 dollars.
Excuse me.
35 dollars...
Come back again.
Come back, where?
They should wrestle,
not play soccer.
One pair in two months...
Name, telephone, and address, OK?
The last, you write
your signature here.
Nice.
- Good.
- Installments of 300 dollars.
If you are late three months,
- Installments...
- I'll take it right back.
- OK?
- He's got a lot of sales.
- This is, your key.
- Great skill.
That's what you call
business, unlike...
Unlike?
- Go away.
- Bye.
- Drive safely.
- OK.
Bye.
They only buy Jeep cars.
Sit.
It looks good.
Thank you for the meal.
Mr. Park guarantees,
so I lend you money.
I did?
I don't give loans to people
with no money income.
Tastes good.
Spicy fish soup is always good.
OK, look here.
You all got the shoes, right?
So this is called
monthly installments.
(Moddabio)
Why were you late?
Go.
I'm in the middle of talking,
I'll get confused.
So this is...
An installment system of pay.
Meaning it's based on trust.
So in English that is...
Trust... Something.
Anyhow.
Anyhow.
It means I trust you.
So I'll give you
these soccer shoes.
And what do you need to do?
Take them.
That's right, take. OK.
Welcome, OK.
And...
Hey, listen up.
I'm talking.
This is important.
One day, one time, one dollar.
That's what you need
to give to me.
What? What did I say?
One day, one time, one dollar.
That's what you need
to give to me.
Sounds good?
And it's not even that long.
Just two months.
Two months, OK?
It might be more expensive
than paying up front,
but since you're so poor,
it can't be helped.
This can be a good choice too, OK?
Good choice.
Listen and repeat. Good choice.
Good choice.
I say good, you say choice.
- Good.
- Choice.
Good.
Try them on.
Hurry.
Try them on.
That's right.
This way.
Goal.
Zone!
You can't even block that?
Good, Good Bagus.
Since you started
wearing soccer shoes,
your game has gotten better.
Bagus, Bagus.
Good, very good.
Alright then.
One day, one time, one dollar, OK?
You remember?
One dollar.
- Ricky.
- OK.
- Name?
- Ricky.
- And?
- Adda.
Adda, good looking guy. Adda.
Ricardo.
- Abebi.
- OK, Abebi.
- Next?
- Abai.
Abai, good, Abai.
- Next?
- Shiku.
- Shiku?
- OK, good.
- Who are you?
- Ddinu.
Why does he keep looking at me?
Who's next?
Moddabio.
Hey.
Come here.
What's your name?
Ddua.
Ddua.
You want this, don't you?
One dollar, good looking.
Next.
Moddabio.
One dollar.
Great choice.
Shiku, that's right.
Kick it.
Shoot, shoot.
Don't be so slow...
You have to pass right away.
Don't hesitate?
Shoot, hey...
Just give it to the goalkeeper,
why don't you.
And you missed that?
Why would you play
soccer like that?
Hey, Marzo.
Stop spraying water and
come catch some flies.
I'm not Marzo. I'm Major.
So sensitive.
OK, and what about you?
That's right.
Pass right away like that.
Do it, do it.
Shoot, good.
Bagus, Bagus.
You have to pass.
Good, good.
Hey, are you blocking the dribble?
Pass, pass.
Go to the center, OK.
Good, Dinu.
Good, shoot.
Shoot.
That's how you do it,
Bagus, Bagus.
What's that?
What are they doing on
the soccer field?
You, Korean, leave.
What?
Where the heck is this kid from.
Why are you bothering
the kids' game?
- Bother?
- That's right.
Don't take money from the kids.
You're misunderstanding...
The field...
So I'm not...
renting out the field...
It's soccer shoe money.
You've misunderstood.
Soccer shoe money?
Yeah, man.
Don't come back here again.
Understand?
Those kinds of guys
are everywhere.
No manners at all.
Why are there so many
obstacles in my life...
It's so hot and humid today.
Looks tasty.
Thanks as always.
Mr. Kim.
I heard you made a big hit by
leasing soccer shoes to children.
My interest.
Where is my monthly interest?
Good sales, no income?
I'm OK.
But Mr. Park, you guaranteed.
It's OK, it's OK.
Mr. Kim.
Doing a sports business in Dili,
I don't think that's a good idea.
Because...
You have to have money even
with soccer and baseball.
You need money to play sports.
Here, everyone is poor.
They have to work.
But the kids here, only just play.
No work.
No money, no soccer,
and no future.
Look at this fish talking.
Who says?
Who says you can't
play soccer if you're poor.
Thank you for the loan.
He said he'll pay
the interest right away.
- Really?
- Yes.
Eat.
But when is the stew coming?
Soon, it'll come out soon.
Here, one dollar. One dollar.
That's right, your name is Shi...
- Shiku.
- Right, Shiku.
Good, you haven't missed once.
You haven't missed one payment.
Learn from him, man.
- Next.
- Dinu.
Dinu also hasn't missed a payment.
You shouldn't default
on the payments.
You're bad kids.
- And you?
- Adda.
Yes, good looking.
You too...
What's this?
How could you return
what you've worn?
You guys really...
Mr. Kim.
Mr. Kim.
I grew this chicken.
And it's bigger than other ones.
There's a lot of meat
and it's strong.
Please don't take my shoes.
Put it down.
Put those shoes down,
gosh you guys.
Alright...
It's fine.
If not today,
then, tomorrow.
If not then, the day after.
When you have money, it's OK.
It's OK, no problem.
When you have money...
Hey, Coach Poong.
This is all an investment.
Hey.
What the heck are
you doing over there?
It's the last time, really.
It's cold here too.
Alright...
Huh?
I can't really hear.
That's fine.
Hang up.
Hello?
Is it Sang-chul?
I started an amazing business...
What? Mid-term?
OK, then you should study.
OK, I'll hang up.
Sorry for bothering you.
Tell Mom that I...
Even if we wear shoes,
there's no field.
So we can't kick the ball.
And a dollar a day is too hard.
Hey!
Mr. Kim, welcome.
You want to buy something?
I'll give you seven fish
for 15 dollars, OK?
OK my butt.
Whether it's OK or PK,
the kids I loaned out
the shoes to...
are playing soccer.
Who are you to bother them?
Me?
I never bothered them.
I just didn't want you
to trick them, you know.
Trick them?
When did I trick them?
Playing sports barefoot
is dangerous.
For sports, you need safe...
for technique...
so that more... jeez.
They'll level up.
So selling soccer shoes
isn't a trick.
Not a scheme to sell soccer shoes,
but to make them better?
That's right, you're smart.
Prove it, then.
- Proof?
- Show me.
Fine.
Let's play a game, you and me.
What?
My kids vs your kids.
If your kids win,
I'll give up on using the field.
But if my kids win,
stay out of my business, OK?
OK, Mr. Kim,
when do you want to do this?
About ten days?
OK, I'll need some time.
After ten days.
OK, one pig.
One pig or two pigs is fine too.
OK, one pig.
Are you really going to do it?
Are you really going to do it?
I don't know, I don't know.
So don't talk to me.
You don't think
before you act, do you?
So why would you sell...
soccer shoes in a country
that's hard to make a living in?
It's not going to work.
If you knew so well,
why didn't you tell me earlier?
I always do my best to tell you.
Shut up.
How much is a pig?
- A pig?
- Yeah.
About 300 dollars?
What? Freaking pig...
There are pigs everywhere.
Why is it so expensive?
Gosh, what the pig, really.
Hey, bring me two balls.
Good, next.
Goodness.
Fail.
Next.
He seemed OK, why?
Short.
Are you choosing
a basketball team or something?
Next.
Are you a guy, or a girl?
This is a men's soccer team.
Next.
Next.
Starting now...
you're my team.
We're one team.
I'm the coach.
And you're the players.
- OK?
- OK.
Starting now,
you listen to what I say.
You must.
If you don't,
no uniform.
And no soccer shoes.
- OK?
- OK!
Good.
Do you think you'll get
your soccer field back like this?
Field, field.
Think of the field. Field.
How long are you going
to play soccer in the dust?
It seems really hard.
Good thing you didn't
have to do it, right?
Hey.
That's right, run.
Shiku, run.
OK? Run.
Hey.
Run, Moddabio!
- Rest, drink some water.
- Yes.
What the heck, we aren't
kicking balls. We only run.
I don't want to do
this starting tomorrow.
- You?
- I don't know,
I feel like I'm dying.
Idiots.
You were so happy
that he gave you...
those ugly shoes and uniform.
But look now?
Forget it, I don't even want
to fight with a jerk like you.
Antonio.
(Day of Pig Bet)
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?
- The kids on my team.
- My team?
They're all on my team.
These big guys are adults.
Why? Is something wrong?
It's my team.
It's different from what you said.
It's a match between
your team and my team?
Why? You scared?
How dare he blow wind in my ear...
Shameless coward...
Jerk...
Listen well.
Ricky, run.
Look far and pass the ball.
- OK.
- OK.
- OK?
- OK.
Hey, hey kid.
Geunapa Ddagut, Ddagut.
Hey, Ddagut.
Ready,
Nangis, you?
Don't be so scared.
Goodness.
Ready, Persia, start.
Persia, Persia, Persia,
we can do it!
Good. We can do it!
Defense, defense.
Pass, pass.
Defense, defense.
Good job.
He could be a pro player
in Indonesia.
Does Indonesia have
a pro soccer team?
You didn't know?
Some of the better ones
dream to be on that team.
If they get on the team,
their life is set.
- In-gi.
- Yeah?
Please give me
200 dollars to buy a pig.
Thanks for the meal.
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?
I heard you folded your business,
is that true?
How did you, so soon...
Goodness...
No.
I work.
- Work?
- Yes.
My pig lost, until it returns,
two jobs.
- Two jobs?
- Two jobs.
You work two jobs too.
Sell cars and give loans.
You're going to do it again?
I didn't work hard
enough last time.
As long as I get them
in top shape,
even an adult team can't win.
The Hyundai soccer team
has skills and teamwork.
Anyhow, I'm going to keep at it
until I have a pig farm.
Just looking at you
makes me feel sad.
It's not enough to be
good at kicking a ball.
You have to be big and strong.
You're too short and skinny.
Hey!
Do it right, kid.
Focus.
Right away, right away.
You aren't choosing
national players.
Can't you just let him play?
They kick balls around
when young for fun.
But if they don't get in
because of their proportions,
do you know how
upsetting that is?
So now you're worried
about their futures?
You need to worry
about a pig first.
Don't look down on my brother.
Silly Korean.
Excuse me.
How do I go there?
Go this way.
Thank you.
Ramos.
Anyone home?
Ramos.
Hi, Ramos.
Do you want to try playing soccer?
Leave, I don't want to
play soccer with you.
Listen 'til the end.
Korean, what are you doing here?
Excuse me...
I was just...
Calm down.
What do you want?
He was looking around our house.
What are you doing here?
I'm not here to see you.
I have business with Ramos.
He seemed good,
so I wanted to teach him.
You want to train Ramos?
- You?
- Yeah.
You train Ramos?
Yeah.
Stop dreaming.
I train Ramos, not you.
Next year,
I will take him to Indonesia.
Pro?
Gosh you...
Do you even know what that is?
You don't even know
a thing about soccer.
Stop being cocky and move.
Ramos?
I'll give you soccer shoes
if you come to my team.
I'll give you a nice pair.
Even if you're good at soccer,
your brother won't buy you shoes.
I'm giving you shoes
to make you on my team.
OK?
I'm scouting your brother.
This is a pro.
That's how the pro world works.
It's a cold place out there.
Hey, Korean.
I'm warning you.
You said you won't sell soccer
shoes to the kids, remember?
Even 'til the end, you...
Ramos, you decide for yourself.
This is a bit worrisome.
It's hot.
A lot of Koreans returned.
There probably aren't
even ten Koreans left.
Something might happen soon.
What riches are you looking for
in a place like this?
Where's the red pepper flakes?
Such a waste...
What? Where is it?
- What?
- Red pepper flakes.
Look around,
it'll be there somewhere.
Your loss if I can't find it.
(Shiku, 12 years old, stable,
striker, mid-field)
(Good manners and good looking,
240 size shoes?)
If I play soccer with you,
can I really get on
the Indonesia Pro Team?
If you work hard.
Can you promise me?
How can I promise that?
Ricky.
Ramos.
Ramos, good.
It hasn't been long since
you've joined, but good.
Moddabio, hey.
Do it right.
Ramos is good as soon as he came.
Pig bet. One more time.
Again?
You want to lose again, Mr. Kim?
This time, three pigs.
My kids eat a lot.
OK, OK.
You just put the time and date.
Don't worry.
You had better practice so
you don't embarrass yourself.
Why are you laughing?
Steal it. Steal it.
Steal it. Steal it.
Hey, are you OK?
Moddabio.
There isn't a big problem...
But it's his eyes.
His eyes?
A lack of nutrition is causing
a short-term sight loss.
One.
Two.
Four.
There are a lot of kids like this.
Because they
don't get enough to eat.
If he's left like this,
he'll go blind.
What? Blind?
Poong, write this down.
Sian Soft Cap.
Soft, Soft.
OQ-10.
ENG Soft Cap.
Nutrition for eyes.
And vitamins.
Please send it as soon as you can.
Please.
OK, thanks.
Blind...
Kim.
Kim.
Kim.
I told you things
might get dangerous.
- Behind you.
- What? What are they.
Be careful.
Korean diplomats!
Korean diplomats!
Thank you.
Do they really
shoot guns and stuff?
Does it seem like a joke?
What about my kids?
You're concerned about them?
- Brother, I want to go too.
- Don't come out.
I want to go and fight, too.
- I want to go and fight, too.
- Stay in there.
Brother, I want to go too!
Let's wait a bit here,
before we go.
It's going to be like a beehive.
Hey...
That's my Ramos, Ramos.
What? Why would he be here?
- Ramos.
- Kim! Kim!
Kim!
Gosh, Kim.
Ramos.
Ramos.
Ramos.
This way, this way.
I want to live.
What are you doing!
What are you doing!
A Korean person.
- What are you talking about?
- I...
I think a Korean person was shot.
I'd know if there
was a Korean person!
No, I heard it.
I heard Korean!
My gosh, this guy.
Open, hurry.
Wait, wait.
A person is dying.
Hurry, hurry.
Please, I want to live...
- Shin Young-hoon.
- I want to live...
- You know him?
- Yeah, he came yesterday.
- Are you OK, sir?
- Piggyback.
I want to live...
- I want to live.
- Wait, my hair...
My hair...
- I want to live.
- Wait...
I want to live...
You'll have to let
go for me to help.
Hey.
Hey, man.
You didn't go home?
Boss, I protected the store.
Hey, man.
Ddua!
Is it good?
Is it good?
It's good.
Where do you live?
In the Catholic Church.
Catholic Church?
You don't have a home?
You don't have parents?
They died.
Is that so?
My brother is good at running.
How much is it?
Five dollars.
Are you joking, right now?
It's expensive.
Is it here?
Moddabio's house?
Who is it?
Moddabio, you scared me.
Where were you?
Soccer.
Soccer?
Aren't we going to play soccer?
None of the kids are there.
Anyhow...
How are your eyes?
Pig...
We need to get the pigs back.
And the field.
You kid...
Mr. Kim.
Let's go play soccer.
Mr. Kim, let's go play soccer.
You kids...
Hey, Ramos.
Where's your brother?
Korean! What are you doing here?
Let's play that game of soccer.
Of course, three pigs.
Anytime.
Next week, 2 PM.
You laugh now?
Don't forget.
Ramos.
You're coming out right?
You're a pro.
Moddabio, pass.
Up high.
Moddabio, run.
Moddabio, you're late. Again.
Ricky, center.
- Good, Bagus.
- You can't even do that?
Ramos, you were late
so run ten laps.
Moddabio.
In position.
Bring the ball.
Go get the ball,
do you expect me to get it?
Continue.
Ddua.
Do you want to kick the ball
with your friends?
Do you really want to do it?
OK...
If you want to do it that much,
alright.
But...
You're smaller than others
so you have to run faster.
OK?
Josephine.
(Speaking in East Timor language)
Ddua.
Goodness, in front of your sister.
Hey!
The start is slow.
Moddabio, run faster.
Ramos, imagine
the location in your head.
- OK?
- OK.
Good job.
Good, one more time.
(Second Pig Bet Game)
Hey, this way.
Run, run.
Good.
Mr. Kim.
Mr. Kim, I've brought the pigs.
I'll give it to you cheap,
buy this one.
Gosh, it'll jinx the game.
My team is going to win,
go over there.
Hey, Ramos.
Good, run.
Moddabio, Moddabio.
OK, pass.
Pass, pass.
Pass, pass.
Ddua, pass.
Shoot.
What have you done to the kids?
Wow, we might win. We might win.
Good job, kids.
Good.
Moddabio, pass, pass.
Ramos, Ramos.
Pass.
Hey, kid.
Oh my, how complicated.
Ramos's brother was hurt...
because of the people
on Moddabio's side.
And in the previous independence
movement, Moddabio's dad died...
after being shot by Ramos's uncle.
The problem just
doesn't end there.
The kids remember everything.
And they will seek revenge.
They finally got independence
from Portugal and Indonesia...
but everything got complicated,
and it's hard to tell who's
a friend and who's an enemy.
In a country where they're
still fighting about sides,
what the heck am I doing here?
How upsetting.
Mr. Kim.
How about a match with
the Indonesian kids in West Timor?
If you find a common enemy...
outside the country,
I'm sure they'll stick together.
What? An international match?
What shima?
Hiroshima.
What do you think?
Great idea, right?
- Gosh, you have big dreams.
- That's right, dreams!
That's what the kids need,
something...
Like a dream!
They need to consider
their situations too.
It's hard to even eat and
make a living here.
Soccer is just a hobby.
Hey, man!
What the heck...
If they're poor,
their dreams have to be poor too?
I didn't know you were
that kind of person, really...
That's not what I meant...
Yeah, Hiroshima.
So how are you doing to get there?
That's why, In-gi.
That's why I came looking for you.
Me?
- Why?
- Why do you think?
Why would I come looking for you?
Why do you think?
- Your muscles are tense here.
- You, really.
This isn't a soccer league?
It's a consulate.
Do you think I'm the minister
of sports here or something?
Yes, you can meet
the minister of sports.
Wow, you're amazing.
Shut up!
Am I talking to a kid or...
Come out!
I'm so busy.
Stop talking nonsense.
In-gi.
In-gi, I'm going to go.
I'll go, jeez.
By plane?
Want me to swim? Stupid.
OK.
You have to work harder,
starting now.
And don't fight.
You...
If you behave like that overseas,
it'll be an embarrassment, OK?
- Got that?
- Yes, sir.
One team!
- East Timor.
- Yes, sir.
If you do well over there,
you'll be scouted, OK?
OK.
Are you crazy?
You should say, ""Yes, sir.""
Maybe I didn't teach you?
- Anyhow, got it?
- Yes, sir.
It's so hard.
Hey...
You should do something like this.
It's impossible.
Stop wasting your time and
give up then, OK?
I can't.
Wait a bit, I have a plan.
This English, Jinglish...
Whatever it is,
can't you do it for me?
How do I spell your name?
Is it ki? Or gi?
I'll just go with gi.
And you're a ""man?""
What's this?
Coach Park In-gi?
What are you doing!
Do you think I just play around?
I'm a Korean diplomat.
But we need two coaches.
Just take a vacation,
you need some rest too.
That's why you look so old.
I said, no!
During this vacation...
my parents set me up...
I need to get married too.
Alright.
Mr. Shin.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
And I brought
the person you wanted to see.
It's Kim Won-gwang
- Kim Won-gwang?
- Yes.
You're Kim Won-gwang?
Oh...
I saved him after being shot...
How could he do that to me?
You borrowed money here
and there...
to start a timber business
in Indonesia, right?
One of the loaners was
Shin Young-hoon.
I didn't borrow that money.
I didn't even know who he was.
You know it. You saw!
So you should go
inside and explain.
Nothing will
be resolved like this.
Of course our consulate...
doesn't have the power
to send you to Korea...
or anything like that.
But the work you're doing now...
is related to children
so it's a bit sensitive.
Honestly, for us,
the only thing we can do
is advise that you return.
Gosh, bunch of red tape officials.
Whether in Korea, or here, jeez.
But he really tried to
let you off easy.
Let me off easy!
He was telling me to get
the heck out of here.
Hey, I was scammed too.
If I knew how to con someone,
why would I be bad
at this one too?
Goodness...
In my opinion...
instead of being chased out,
it's to go quietly.
I try to do something and
it all gets messed up.
Pass, OK.
Ddua.
Hey, Shiku!
When I become an adult,
I'm going to kill you.
Yeah right, I'll kill you first.
Hey, kids!
What are you doing right now?
Gosh...
How could I think you'd
be able to play soccer?
I must have been crazy.
Go!
Whether you fight or shoot guns...
Do what you want.
Do whatever you want.
Hey, Coach Poong. Do you remember?
When we used to kick balls behind
Oscar Theater in the alleyway.
Of course I remember.
Hey, come to think of it,
we were really happy then.
Just kicking the ball around
made us so happy.
Hey.
Forget the sentimentalism.
Hey.
If things haven't worked out
for you there, just come back.
I found a place for you, OK?
It's a middle school soccer team.
The pay isn't bad, either.
This is how we have to
make a living, don't you think?
Think this over.
Another chance like this
is hard to come by.
Won-gwang
Won-gwang
Hey, you listening?
Won-gwang
Did he fall asleep?
(ROK Consulate)
In-gi, I'm pitiful right?
No, not pitiful...
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said
that in front of the consul.
We can try harder from now on.
Do you know what my nickname
was when I played soccer?
Every time I kicked a ball,
I missed.
They called me
the Frightening Miss.
What are you talking about?
Don't be like that...
Let's go have a drink.
In-gi.
I'm going to go back to Korea.
He said he'll really help you
get on the pro team?
I'm preparing for a match.
He's just a con artist.
He got found out,
so he's running away to Korea.
It was all a show to
sell some soccer shoes.
Ramos, I always tell you.
We just need to trust each other.
There's no need to
trust foreigners.
Let's eat.
Ramos.
Be well.
Give the remaining shoes
and stuff to the kids.
Thanks for everything, Marzo.
You aren't going to
say bye to the kids?
I won't be able to leave
if I see them.
And nothing could make
you leave before.
I said let's not talk so much, OK?
Come see me if you stop by Seoul.
Bye.
Mr. Kim!
Ramos is at the police station.
Ramos?
Hey, Ramos.
Wait, wait.
Why would you put
handcuffs on him?
I mean how much is that
car audio anyway?
- Please move.
- Huh? Wait.
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
This guy fixed up his car.
How much is it?
It's not just any sound system.
It's called a Van Allen Woodson.
So how much is it?
Four thousand, it broke
when he tried to take it out.
Why did you do it!
- Hey, stop.
- It's none of your business!
Hey!
- Are you a thief?
- Stop it!
It's none of your business!
Ramos, why did you do it?
I wanted to go take the test
for the Indonesia Pro Team.
I could have showed
my skills in Hiroshima,
but now we can't go...
Please forgive him.
I'll work until
I can pay you back.
Please forgive him.
Please.
Working with that kind of money...
Take this.
This is all I have.
He's only 11 years old.
Please pardon him.
It's none of your business.
It's not time to be prideful,
you idiot.
Ramos.
I'm really sorry.
That I couldn't do it
until the end.
Mr. Kim, don't go.
We'll try our best.
Mr. Kim...
Don't just leave us here.
Mr. Kim...
Don't go.
Mr. Kim, don't go.
Mr. Kim, don't go.
Mr. Kim, don't go.
Mr. Kim, don't go.
Mr. Kim, don't go.
Kim Won-gwang...
I'm so embarrassed.
I was so embarrassed,
I couldn't hold my head up.
They're such good kids.
What could they like
about a guy like you?
I know.
But what a waste?
What about your
coaching position in Seoul?
Hey.
I'm not some neighborhood coach.
I don't coach unless
it's a national team.
That is...
I...
I wasn't conning you.
If I was that kind of guy...
when the bullets
were raining down,
would I go to save a person?
Is that so...
Did I ask you to save me?
Well, you were
bleeding like a pig,
and grabbed my hair
asking me to save you.
And I lost all that hair,
and it's pretty empty
in that area.
People call you a con
because you're so nosey.
And what?
Hiroshima?
- Goodness.
- How did you know?
So now you're investigating me
behind my back?
I called Consul Oh.
So go find him.
Sorry? Why?
Aren't you going to meet
the Minister of Sports?
Oh my...
Oh, Oswaldo.
Thank you for your help.
See you.
Thankfully we got
the minister's permission.
What's the use?
And what's the use of passports?
We don't have any money.
Kim Won-gwang, you've gotten soft.
Look at you.
Who makes a v-sign
when taking passport photos?
That idiot.

- Mr. Big?
- Yes.
Hello. I'm Kim Won-gwang.
Nice to meet you.
This is a paper for East Timor,
the children...
have no money to pay for a ticket
to go to Hiroshima for soccer.
The children's dreams...
Gosh, what will I do?
They said they'll look over it,
so we can wait.
Soccer...
So what!
Why did you bring this?
Mr. Kim.
Thank you.
Ricardo.
And Dinu.
Pendi.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Kim, will you be able to
get the ticket money like this?
I'm just doing what I can.
I'm doing my best.
What if we can sell
broadcasting rights?
- Broadcasting rights?
- Yes.
Are you kidding?
This is medicine for your eyes.
These are vitamins.

to see it to the end...

The second half is about to begin.
East Timor is behind two points.
The score is 2:0.
It seems their hearts and
bodies have stiffened up...
from playing in a cold and
unfamiliar land.
But our young athletes...
we believe they can do well
in the second half.
Please cheer them on.
You can do it!

You can do it, right?
Can you change
the athlete like that?

He should run as much as he can.

down as coach?

From the left,
Ramos breaks through.
We see Moddabio nearby.
Ramos, Moddabio.
Pass!
Ramos misses his chance
to pass and runs again.
Oh, how sad.
It was great timing to pass.
They lose the centering timing.
Let's take one person out and
keep going as planned, yeah?
First game, Moddabio.
Second game, Ramos.
If they happen to fight...
it'll be
an international embarrassment.
What are you doing?
Look at him, that kid.
Let's take one guy out.
According to Dojo,
who is at the match,
our athletes are very skilled...
but the international game
is quite difficult.
Ddua, pass to Ramos!
Good.
Here, here.
Good, good.

Ramos is running quickly
into the line.

by the opposite team.

this isn't the last.

I think I'm sure.

they believe in me.

2:2, tied score.
Everyone, it's finally a tie.
Our young Timor athletes...
are having a great game.
If they just get one more goal,
it'll be our win.
Ddua runs quickly.
And runs toward the goal.
Pass.
Amazing.
A penalty kick. There was a foul.
Dduda gets a penalty kick chance.
Penalty kick!
There's one minute
until the end of the game.
You can do it Ramos.
Ramos! Ramos!
No goal.
It was a failed kick.
It's OK. It's OK.
Keep on!
There's not much time.
This is the last chance.
They have a corner kick chance.
They have to hurry,
there's not much time.
We hope you'll cheer
them on as much as you can.
Shoot, shoot!

10,A Bear Named Winnie (2004) - full transcript,"It's 1914, the beginning of WWI. In White River, Ontario, en route to a training camp in Valcartier, QuÃ©bec, with the Winnipeg section of the Canadian Army Veterinary Corps, Army Lieutenant Harry Colebourn, who has a natural rapport with animals, saves a black bear cub from being killed by a hunter, who killed the cub's mother. Not knowing what else to do with the cub, Harry brings her along to camp to act as the unit's mascot, who he names Winnie - short for Winnipeg. Most of the men in the unit bond with Winnie, but having such a mascot is against the wishes of the head of the Canadian Expeditionary Force's veterinary division, Colonel Barret. Barret is a tough but fair man, who may have more problems than Winnie in the form of the Expeditionary Force's commanding officer, General Hallholland, a dipsomaniac who uses his position in the army for his own vainglorious purposes. Winnie's stay with Harry and the unit is not always a smooth one, especially in trying to stay under Barret's radar. Over time, Winnie becomes completely tame, craving human companionship, which Harry realizes is a problem as the unit is scheduled to get shipped overseas to England and eventually to France to do their duty on the front lines. Sending Winnie back into the wild may no longer be a viable option, as Winnie has a mind of her own, but finding a home for her where she will get the human companionship she craves or else possibly die from not having what she needs - which means an owner that understands that she's no ordinary bear - may be a problem.","Winnie!
Pity we haven't
got any honey.
Do you think
he'd prefer honey?
Winnie, that's
what they call her.
--Real thing.
Yeah, Tommy,
come have a look here.
She likes honey
best, you know.
That's what they like.
- Honey?
Yeah, that's
what they like to eat.
Winnie.
Winnie, over here!
Winnie!
That's enough, children.
Kindly pick that
up, young man.
You can't just litter
the place with sticky--
Gah!
Father, why do
they call her Winnie?
Well, I--
I don't know, really.
It's a funny
name for a bear.
Yes, I suppose it is.
I wonder how she got it.
Got what?
Her name, silly.
Yes, I wonder.
I'll bet it's quite a story.
Hey, bear.
Hey, bear.
Bear, you get down from there.
Come on, get!
You won't get no
sympathy from me.
A bear's a bear.
Stop that, right now!
All right,
no more bets.
No more bets.
You need.
Give me one, Captain.
Oh, just one?
Just one, huh?
All right, there's mine too.
All right, are weplaying cards here or what?
Are you playing cards?
- I'm in, Harry.
Who needs cards?- Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's
play some poker, here.
- How about you?- You know, playing cards--
Three.
--Is a good way
to pass the time.
You're being
annoying again, Taylor.
Sorry, Harry.
Uh, Sir.
I guess we're in
the army now, eh?
That's right, Corporal.
We are in the army now.
$5 says it falls
in eight seconds. $5.
- I got it!
- Who's in?
Captain's got it.
Corporal collects,
that means you.
All right, let's play in there.
Dougal, are you in there?
Put $5 in here.
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
- OK, OK.
- OK?
All right.
And one, two,
three, four, five--
- Come on!
- Six--
Fall!
Seven--
Eight--
Aah!
I can't believe it!
How did you call that?
Well, you know.
What am I going to say?
CONDUCTOR: White River, 20 minute stop.
White River's next.
Look out!
Go, get out of the way!
Get back!
Get back!
Get back!
Get back!
- Easy!
- Get back!
Easy!
All right, steady
up with you now.
Shoot him!
We got him.
We got him.
Get that horse.
Whoa.
Whew.
Hey.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Atta boy.
Atta boy.
Shh.
Atta boy.
Atta boy.
Atta boy.
Shh.
Shh.
Atta boy.
Shh.
Shh.
Atta boy.
Shh.
Just spooked a little.
Walk him.
He'll be fine.
Hey there, baby cub.
Hey.
You're a bit worried, are we?
Not surprising, I suppose.
Help you, soldier?
Cub fur good for anything?
It's not.
So why is she
tied up like this?
Hunter didn't have the gutsto do what has to be done.
I see.
What exactly is it
that had to be done?
Shoot it.
As if I didn't
have enough to do.
I'll tell you what.
I'll shoot her for
you, if you like.
I'm with the Veterinary
Corps, Winnipeg Section.
Cost you $35.
Wait, now hold on.
You know, I thought I wasjust doing you a favor.
What do you want him for?
I didn't say I
wanted anything.
I said I'd shoot her
for you, if you like.
Uh-huh.
$25, and you can wangaway till cows give beer.
Valcartier
train now departing.
All aboard!
Valcartier, train
leaving for Valcartier.
All aboard!
Excuse me, folks, I havea little situation here.
I was wondering if you can--
Egads!
No, she's not dangerous.
She's just a little bit--
A regimental mascot, I'll bet.
Regimental?
No.
I've just been a tad impetuous.
Go give the Kaiser a goodkick in his royal Bosch behind.
Oh, George!
You shouldn't say that.
Huh?
All right, all right.
I understand.
I'm not really a
bear sort of person,
and I have a train
to catch, which means
I'm going to have to find you--
That your bear?
You like bears?
Hmm?
You know that they makewonderful pets, far better
than dogs.
Did you know that?
My dog died.
Oh, I'm sorry.
All aboard!
You must be sad.
Hey, what's your name?
Timmy McMurray.
Timmy McMurray.
Well, I tell you
what, Timmy McMurray.
How would you like to have abear for your very own pet?
Huh?
Timmy.
Get away from that man.
Can we have
the bear, Mommy?
Bears make good pets.
He said.
Don't be silly, dear.
Little children don't
have bears for pets.
Even big, brave
soldiers know that.
What am I going
to do with you?
Hmm?
You're going to get me
in trouble, aren't you?
Aren't you?
You're gonna get me in trouble.
Who's your friend, Harry?
She got a name?
What were
you thinking, Harry?
Captain's not
going to like this.
I can't believe
you got a bear, Harry.
What's your
name, little fella?
Aww, she's a sweetie.
Have you
trained him yet?
Is it a she?
Is it a she-bear?
Is this a she-bear?
You bought her?
I bought her.
For how much?
20.
Holy smokes, Harry.
That-- That's a pair.
You got a pair, there.
- Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.
- Yes, you do.
A wild bear.
Thank you, Taylor.
Wild bear on a train.
Harry, what are
you doing with that?
To tell you
the truth, Captain,
it's not really an ambitionof mine to own a bear,
but the circumstances were--
It's wild, sir.
A wild bear.
I can see that.
Her mother was shot,
and she was next.
You know the rules.
Yes, I do.
He knows the rules.
Taylor.
Sorry, Harry, Captain.
I'm, uh, just, uh--
You can't keep a pet.
Pet?
Is that what you think?
Well, whatever it
is, you can't keep it.
That's the rule, is it?
Afraid so.
And rules are rules.
There you have it.
Well, there's no rule
against having a mascot.
Mascot?
No rule against mascot.
Unit mascot, what
do you say, boys?
This is an opportunity!
Mascot with no name?
Of course she's got a name.
Uh-huh?
Come on, Harry.
Come on!
Winnipeg.
- That's right!
Winnipeg?
Is that a good
name for a bear?
Winnie for short.
Winnie it is!
Winnie.
Yeah, I like that.
Winnie.
Winnipeg, all right.SOLDIER: Hey, Winnie!
Winnie!
Come here, Winnie!
We've got a mascot.
No bears on my train.
Oh, uh--
Well, hold on now, sir.
This is no ordinary bear, sir.
No exceptions.
He's the, uh--
Uh, she's.
She's the unit mascot.
I don't give a hoot if she'sthe King's great-grandmother.
I won't have a beardefecating all over my train.
She's not defecating.
Will be.
You can count on it.
You can count on that.
Sir, we're allwith the Veterinary Corps.
We've all been trained
to deal with animals
of all shapes and sizes.
Look, sunshine.
Wild critters don't give twohoots where they defecate,
and this here one
won't be defecating
where it's against the rules.
And that would be in
first-class coach.
You want to keep a bear?
You keep it in freight.
Crawford.
Sir?
Good morning, sir.
And what the devil do theythink they're doing with those?
Osbourn.
- Sir!
Pack my charger.
Absolute mess.
What do you think it is?
It's nothing but a mess.
And there's no drainage here.
Move the tents up the slope.
Yes, sir.
And for heaven's
sake, keep them in rows.
You can't have
tents helter-skelter
all over the place.
Order and discipline, lads.
That's what wins wars.
Yes, sir.
- Carry on.
- Sir!
Crawford.
What do you make of that ragtagbunch at the end of the ranks?
Veterinary Corps, sir, Winnipeg Section.
Blasted cowboys.
Fetch, uh, what's his name?
That new man.
Come on, what's his name?
What's his name?
Colonel Barret, sir.
Barret, thank you.
Have him deal with it.
Yes, sir.
Canadian Army VeterinaryCorps, Winnipeg Section
reporting for duty, sir.
Prepare for inspection.
I'm Barret, Chief VeterinaryOfficer and Director
of Veterinary Services.
I don't care who your fatheris, what school you went to,
or any of that
high-brow baloney.
As of this moment you
represent your country
as part of the 1st
Division of the Canadian
Expeditionary Force.
From all the
information I can gather
and what I can see
with my own two eyes,
your military training
has been slight to nil.
That's Winnie, sir.
Short for Winnipeg.
Our unit mascot, sir!
Get rid of it.
Eyes front!
I don't believe in
mascots, and you men
must close your picnic
hampers and begin
to harden your hearts.
What you are about
to face is more
vicious and terrifying
than anything
you can possibly imagine.
Carry on.
You can't just leave
her in the woods.
There's wolves and
foxes and coyotes and--
Thank you, Corporal.
She wants you to, um--
Yes, I'm aware of that.
Yeah, it can't be this row.
It's got to be the next row.
Well, maybe another
regiment will take her.
I mean there's no regulation--
The order was
to get rid of her.
Well, you never
used to follow orders.
Yes, we're having
a lovely little war,
now though, aren't we?
Harry.
I think we found your billet.
Get up there!
Why are you being such a--
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Can we give you a hand?
No.
No, thank you.
I'm Harry Colebourn.
This is Captain Elliot.
Oh, oh yes, hello.
Uh, Ian Macray, formerKings College scholar now
colonial fodder for a
pompous imperial empire.
Let me.
We're tentmates, I think.
Oh.
Well.
As a man thinks, so he becomes.
Huh?
Harry, I have some news, andyou're not going to like it.
I-- I was tying her up righthere, and then I looked away.
And then I looked back, andshe-- she- she was gone.
Taylor!
All right, split up.
Let's go!
Wh-- wh-- who-- who's gone?
It's Winnie.
Who's Winnie?
It's our bear.
Oh.
Have you seen a black
bear cub through here?
Is his mother around?
Here we go.
Anything?
No.
What's going on?
Bear!
Get back here!
Get out of my
kitchen, get out!
Get out!
Hold on!
Hey.
Enough, bear.
Back to the woods with you.
Come here.
Ten-hut!
Fine thing, mascot.
Had one myself once
in South Africa.
Sir Hugo.
Supercilious old billy goat.
Took his last time with
us at Paardeberg Drift.
Stray flare caught the
munitions, and dear
old fellow burnt to a crisp inthe of.
Yes, well, in any event hewas awfully good for morale.
They're noble creatures, bears.
You make sure you
look after him, Major.
It's Lieutenant, sir.
And move this tent!
It's a pig sty!
Do you know why we don'thave women in the army?
Actually, sir,
I've often wondered.
When
the shooting starts,
the men rush to protect.
To fight and live requiresa soldier's full attention.
Eye on the ball, not the bear.
Yes, sir, but
the general seems
quite adamant about
having a mascot as--
Yes, I understand
the situation.
You have a week or so.
Do what you need to doto take care of your bear
before we leave for England.
Yes, sir.
So they have teeth, ofcourse, and the intestinal tract
of a carnivore.
But--
Come here.
Winnie.
Uh, but they, um, they'reopportunistic eaters and--
which makes them
omnivorous and explains
their fondness for ants.
She'd have to
eat a great number.
Yes, that would be
a factor, wouldn't it.
It says here their
olfactory sense--
that means you-- is
more acute than a dog's
by the power of seven.
Isn't that amazing?
Yeah, that's why
their noses are bigger.
Huh?
Oh!
Actually--
Winnie, come down from there.
Winnie!
Her-- her preferred foods are, um, nuts, acorns, insects, uh--
Winnie bear.
- --Succulent greens, and honey.- Winnie!
And, um, and, uh, berries.
Winnie!
Winnie!
But, uh, but I think--
I think it's a little late inthe season for-- for berries.
Oh dear!
- Winnie bear!
Winnie bear!
Oh!
You know a lot
about bears, do you?
Well, not much I don't
know about, really.
I thought so.
Yes.
I think what's important isthat she needs to learn how
to defend herself and
forage for herself
and, uh, and to sleep-- oh!
And to sleep alone.
Winnie!
Winnie!
Wonderful, isn't it?
Macray, no offense intended, but what in the name of glory
are you doing in uniform?
Know everything, done nothing.
That's me in a nutshell.
What?
What?
You hungry?
Don't wake him up.
Don't wake him up.
Go back.
Come here.
Winnie!
Winnie!
Taste good?
Comeon, everybody.
Pull those tents
down!
Up.
Up.
Good Winnie.
Good.
Good Winnie.
Good bear.
Wha-- wha-- what's--what are you-- that's-- no,
the-- the horse is--
This horse is old and sick.
What-- no, they
don't have to do that.
No, no.
She's contagious.
But no, it's not.
I've ruled it out.
It's not epizootic
lymphangitis, and it's
not glanders or farcy either.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
There's a swelling.
It's a-- a-- a-- ch--
perhaps a boil or
maybe a splinter.
A splinter?
Yes!
Sergeant Major.
Professor Macray here seems tothink old Zeb's fit and able.
This animal?
I can see he is sick.
Just give me a minute.
Easy.
Easy, Zeb.
Easy.
Hey, good boy.
Good.
Shh.
Oh.
It's all right.
Steady.
Come here.
Atta boy.
Atta boy.
Up, up, up.
Oh!
Easy.
Easy.
Shh.
Atta boy.
Atta boy.
Easy.
Easy.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Shh.
Atta boy.
Atta boy.
Easy, easy.
Good boy.
Shh.
Good boy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Come here.
Come here.
Want some apple, huh?
Comeon, pull those tents down.
And move this tent!
Ready and pull!
I said pull, you lummox.
Just slow and steady
effort, the way
you would remove
a burr from a cat.
Ready and pull!
General, may I have a word?
General Hallholland, theconstant relocation of tents
robs the men of valuable
time for training--
I understand you graduatedtop of your class at RMC.
Sir, the men need
practical training.
They have no idea what's
facing them in France
So you must be related tothe Montreal Barrets, huh?
Old Charlie Barret
and I, we played
rugby together at McGill.
My father was a miner,
barely spoke English,
and as far as I know he
never played any type
of game his entire life.
Oh.
We depart by convoy in 48 hours.
That will be all.
No,.
Stampede!
Come on, let's go.
Stampede!
Wake up!
Go, go!
Stampede
at the stables!
Stampede!
They all went down that way.
Harry!
Harry!
But there must have beensomething that bothered them,
and, uh, it was dark.
It was night.
I just-- I wish I
could have seen.
What did you see?
See?
Well, I-- I didn't see.
What I mean is that it-- itwas dark, and it was quiet.
And then all of a
sudden, uh, you know,
they were kicking or-- or--
Harry!
Find it.
Yes, sir.
Still some are missing.
Look down by the river.
Bear.
What you have done?
This is not good.
Unless you have any
pertinent remarks.
Sir, there's no evidencethat says that Winnie
caused that stampede.
She's wild.
That's all the
evidence necessary.
Sir?
Respectfully, I decline onthe grounds of an oath which
each and every one of
us swore to uphold,
to use our skills for
the benefit of society
through the protection
of animal health
and the relief of
animal suffering, sir.
All right, Lieutenant.
No!
Winnie didn't do it.
What happened was I saw that oldmongrel dog run past on the way
out of the stables, and--
Did you see it
enter the stables?
Well, I-- that-- that--that's just the-- that's just
the thing, sir.
I-- I was, uh--
I must have--
Sir, I fell asleep
at my post, sir.
That's a court martial
offense, Corporal.
Lieutenant, we
strike camp at 0800.
We'll take care of it, sir.
I'm awful sorry, Harry.
I-- you know, I wouldn't
do anything to hurt--
I know.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Easy.
I'm going to set herdown over here in this clearing.
Oh, easy, girl!
Easy, girl.
That's it.
What d-- What does she want?
What does she want from me?
Look, there's some
raisins in my bag
down there, in the satchel.
Girl, good girl.
No, she wants out.
I don't have the raisins, Harry.
We left the raisins.
You're doing great.
She's attacking.
I'm-- Hello.
Good.
Good Winnie.
I'm not sure if she
likes me or not.
I thought you
knew about bears!
Winnie.
Winnie.
These berries?
Uh, bunchberries,
cornus canadensis.
They are very tasty
for bears, but sadly
dried up and out of season now.
Blueberries.
Yes, perfect.
Perfect.
Come on!
Come on, Winnie.
- Show her those.
- Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Look, see?
Berries!
Berries!
Look, berries.
Good.
Good girl.
Good girl.
Shh.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Shh.
OK, go.
Go.
I can't help feeling
we're abandoning her.
Well, perhaps we
should think of it
as returning her to her rightfulplace in the great chain of--
Macray.
Yes, well, she is
unusually clever,
an extraordinary bear, really, asurvivor if there ever was one.
Don't you think?
Do you have any ideas?
You're the smart one.
Well, not like her.
OK, I'm going to put
her down right here.
Let's go!
Move!
Move!
Can she get out of it?
I think, judging by
her past performance.
You're right.
You're right.
Won't take you long,
will it, Winnie?
Hmm?
This is where you belong, girl.
You'll be fine here, OK?
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Winnie.
Forgive my impertinence, Harry, but you're not
Canadian-born, are you?
Or rather, I-- I mean I canjust detect a slight hint of--
My father died
when I was young.
Mother remarried.
I was sent out here at 14.
My uncle's with
the grain exchange.
That's interesting.
Is it?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, it's nothing really.
I just--
Nothing?
If a simple veterinarian
from Winnipeg, Manitoba,
is interesting at all,
I want to know about it.
Well, it's simply that, um, what I find interesting
is that--
well, your sensitivity towardsWinnie being abandoned when--
when you've experienced
something similar
yourself, in a manner of
speaking, more or less.
My good old dad came out herewith a piddling remittance.
You know, the black sheep ofthe family, the feckless son who
just couldn't measure up, and sent to the new world
to seek his fortune.
And unfortunately
his family was right.
And my mother, well, she taughtschool, and she still does.
All of which I suppose
explains why I--
I can speak Latin, but Ican't swim or throw a ball.
When this rotten war is over,
no more soldiering for me.
When I get my civvy clotheson, oh, how happy I shall be.
No more church
parades on Sunday.
No more putting in for leave.
I shall miss that SergeantMajor, how I'll miss him,
how he'll grieve.
When this rotten war is over, no more soldiering for me.
When I get my civvy clotheson, oh, how happy I shall be.
I shall sound my own reveille.
I shall make my own tattoo.
Now this, I must have.
I can't do without.
You know, it's al-- it's alwaysDickens or-- or Longfellow.
Do you find?
I find that it--
No!
Winnie!
Where did you come from?
Winnie!
That's-- that's Winnie!
She-- She's here, but I
thought that you-- well,
it is good that she's here?
No, it's not.
It's not so good, but it'scertainly extraordinary.
Whoa, what are
you going to do?
Because I mean, she's
not so wild anymore.
She obviously likes people.
We can't?
No.
Wh-- wh-- yeah, but we can'ttake her with us, either.
We-- I mean, what
are you going to do?
Smuggle her in your--
in your haversack?
This is not good.
I hope this works.
Private.
Leonard, right?
Well, Leonard--
Let's-- let's go.
Over there.
We got this, Jake.
A big strapping
fellow such as yourself.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Right.
Left.
In a few weeks you will standagainst the Prussian army,
the greatest, strongest, mostprofessional, well-trained
military machine in the world.
I suggest over the next weekyou take a few moments to plan
how you intend to stay alive.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Right.
Left.
Here,
have one of these.
Oh, lovely.
Our-- our dressing stationsare well behind our lines,
so we're not going to
see any real action.
Technically we're still in rangeof their guns so there's always
the off-chance--
One-ton shell might
blow us into next year.
Right.
But what are the odds?
What-- What do you think, Harry?
Wh-- What are the odds?
I think I've made
a terrible blunder.
We can't take Winnie to war.
To the front line?
- No.
She'll end up
like old Sir Hugo.
Or worse.
You're right.
Harry.
What I'm trying to figure is, if Zeb's back to his old self,
then there must be a reason whyyou want to keep him inside.
Well, I don't think anotherday or two of reprieve
would hurt.
Would it, Taylor?
Oh.
No, no, no.
Wait.
I-- I think I know.
It-- it's because
of her, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
It's-- it's because you don'twant Winnie getting lonely,
because boy oh boy,
if she gets lonely,
then the first thing she'sgoing to do is run to camp.
And then the Colonel
and everybody--
Thank you, Taylor.
Sorry, Harry.
Just uh, just had towork that out a bit, huh?
Just, just work it out.
The front is no place
for you either, is it?
Huh?
Old man.
Now you be a brave bear
and look after Taylor.
We'll be back as soon
as we can, all right?
You know what to do
if the brass turns up.
Sure do.
Girl.
We should get
there in plenty of time.
Wait, wait,
wait a minute.
We never discussed we.
It was always you.
The situation's changed.
It needs to be we.
What?
In any event it will
be a walk in the park.
Harry, I'm afraid
I'm not terribly brave.
Haha, you'll get over that.
No, one does not
get over a firing squad.
Sir.
Sir.
Excuse me, sir.
Sir.
Canadian Army, VeterinaryCorps, Winnipeg Section
ready for inspection, sir!
At ease, Corporal.
Where is she?
I have no idea
what you mean, sir.
No idea whatsoever?
Well, yes, sir.
Well, no, sir.
I-- no idea whatsoever, sir.
Very well.
I know she was on the boat.
I have evidence, and
I know she's here.
And when I get to the bottom ofall of this, the bunch of you
will be finding yourselvesfacing disgrace, dishonor,
and a punishment so cruelonly English schoolboys
could have thought of it.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Understand, sir.
No idea whatsoever, sir.
Barret.
This is uh, this
is from Whitehall.
And uh, ha!
I don't know what--
I mean, what the
hell do they know.
I know they need the because apparently it's
machine guns that are
going to win this war.
Listen.
""Each one replaces 80 rifles.""
Codswallop, isn't it?
I mean, what--
and what if it jams?
Eh?
What then?
Well, no, sir.
Thank you very much.
I'll take the 80 rifles
and a crack cavalry.
It's horses that are
key to this fight.
And they always have been, and they always will be.
What do you think, Colonel?
General, may I speak candidly?
Crawford.
Sir!
General, I recommend youlift your ban on alcohol
for our boys and
loosen the restrictions
you've imposed with regardto leaving the base.
Impose?
I don't impose orders, boy.
I give 'em.
And I expect them to be
followed by everyone.
Sir, the men need to letoff steam every now and then.
Yeah, and it's,
um, it's clean living
that keeps my lads sharp, and that means no liquor.
And if they have to go
looking for it off-base,
well, they'll be shot.
Will that be all, Colonel?
Men prepared to sacrificetheir lives for their country
should not be
treated as children.
Don't you tell me
how to run my army.
General, the Canadian
Expeditionary Force
is not your private
army, and I will not
stand by while the
lives of 30,000 men
are compromised by
some vainglorious whim.
Who the hell do
you think you are?
Don't you dare talk
to me like that!
Do you know who I am?
Do you realize the
prime minister--
your father was a
nothing, a nobody,
and that's exactly
where you'll end up if I
have any say in the matter.
Sir, the sun is aboutto set on your day to have
a say in anything that matters.
And as to your other point, my father didn't need to wear
a uniform to be a man of honor.
Get off!
Morning, Colonel.
I knew it.
Come over here.
Come here, you.
OK, don't-- don't--don't do this to me, bear.
I don't-- we-- no, this
doesn't work with--
OK.
OK.
Oh, my goodness, you stink.
I know exactly
where you've been.
Come on, let's go.
Corporal, we need
to have a chat.
Did you sleep well?
Hmm?
Hmm?
No problems last night?
No, sir--
Harry.
Are you all right?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Just another day in--
Gasoline, oil, and oxygen.It's highly combustible.
That's what makes
the engine go.
Yes, I know, but, uh, what I'mwondering is whether, uh, well,
between here and where we'regoing, we-- we wouldn't be
in harm's way at all, would we?
Harry, are you positive
this is the only way?
It's the only fence
that's not patrolled.
Get down!
Down!
Down!
That would be the reason why.
Cease fire!
You, there!
That's no way to
treat your weapon.
Sir?
This here Ross rifle's a
terrible piece of junk.
Heats up.
Jams up all the time.
Breech explodes.
Can't shoot straight,
even if I'm trying to-
It's a poor workman
who blames his tools!
Yes, sir!
All right, listen
up, everybody.
Get down!
Now let me tell you the Rossrepeater is the most perfect
military rifle in the world.
I helped modify it.
This weapon is the mostaccurate weapon ever fired.
Every single one of you
should be able to pink
his enemy every time.
Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
Harry, I must say I
feel rather exposed.
Here, take Winnie.
Not to worry, with
this little beaut
we will be there
and back in no time.
There's not a lot of roomthere for me and the bear,
is it?
What's that?
24-hour pass for both of us--
What?
--Signed by--
Barret!
Do-- do you have any
idea what just occurred?
I think I do.
All right, Winnie.
It's time for you
to do your business.
Still have a fair ways to go.
We don't want you to be doingyour business in the sidecar
as there's not much room for abear's business in the sidecar.
Harry, I've been, uh--
Thinking?
Indeed.
About?
Well, should anything
unfortunate occur,
I would like my mother to, um--
you see, she wasn't for this.
It would be my honor.
Thank you.
But it won't come to that.
Oh, no?
Well, you haven't swallowedthat home by Christmas nonsense,
have you?
No.
Then?
Faith.
That's funny.
What?
I wouldn't have taken youfor a man of the church.
Faith in you.
Henry, come
look and at this!
He's a beast, isn't he?
Ah, look at him.
She is, uh, clean, isn't she?
It doesn't do to,
uh, muck up a zoo
with some mangy,
flea-ridden creature.
They spread disease, you know.
Bears have their own
diseases, of course,
but they affect other animals.
Had a cross-infection betweena giraffe and a beaver once.
Very nasty.
Well, here we are.
One of our larger, more
spacious enclosures.
As secure and reliable
as the Pope has penury.
Oh, now listen.
I shouldn't worry.
She'll soon accustom herself.
They all do.
Winnie's used to a fairbit of human companionship, Mr.
Protheroe.
She-- She's
been tamed, you see.
Yeah, completely tamed.
Yes, well, no animal is evercompletely tame, are they?
Winnie's different.
Look, I can't take risks, notas far as the general public
is concerned.
We know her.
Intimately.
Uh, well, so-- so to speak.
She needs human contact.
Yes, well, she'll have
me and the underkeepers.
We're perfectly convivial.
I don't think youunderstand, Mr. Protheroe.
Believe me, Lieutenant.
I have worked with bears
for the past 20 years.
Yes, they can be beguiling.
They have a-- a knack of
amusing us and putting
us at our ease, so to speak.
But believe me when
I tell you this,
you can never lower
your guard, not
for an instant, not with bears.
I don't think Winnie
knows she's a bear.
Yes, well, listen,
I've got to lock up,
so you, uh, say
your final goodbyes.
All right?
Hey, we have to goaway for a while, Winnie.
OK?
No place for bears, so
you have to stay here.
You understand?
Mr. Protheroe's going
to look after you now.
Stop.
Winnie.
Winnie, play fair.
Play fair.
You're an impossible
bear, you know that?
This is what we're going to do.
I'm going to come back,
and we'll get in a ship.
And we'll go back to Canada.
We'll go home together, promise.
You take care.
You'll be fine here.
All right?
Harry?
I've got a bad feeling.
Time to eat, Winnie.
Lovely bits of fresh fruit.
I cut it meself.
Come on, girl.
Any luck?
Same as every day, sir.
Won't touch nothing.
That was peculiar.
What, sir?
Oh, the way she
just looked at me.
I could have sworn--
Just curious, probably.
No, it was more than that.
It was her eyes.
It wasn't like an animal at all.
It was as if she could
see what I was thinking.
Whatever she is, sir,
she's gonna starve.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid itmay be past that point already.
Well, she's really not lookingvery well at all, is she?
No.
I don't like the look of her.
You know, I think she's
missing the soldiers.
Is it not very well?
What's wrong with the bear?
Have you seen a child come by?
A little girl.
She's wearing a
blue dress, and--
it's a green dress
with, um, brocade.
She had a little gold locket.
Her name is Muriel.
- Muriel?
Muriel McGuiness.
Oh.
Hello.
Do you like biccies?
Here you are.
Ahh!
Uhh.
Ohh.
Oh.
- Muriel!
- Your gun, sir.
Muriel, sweetheart!
Darling, come to me!
The bear's escaped!
Miss McGuiness!
Muriel!
Oh.
Muriel.
A little bear.
Prime minister impatientwith his eccentric ways.
Well, that's a surprise.
Come on, let's move it!
All right, all right.
To
the Eastern flank.
Battalion's falling back.
Where are they coming from?
Through Wood.
Oof!
My men are there!
Pass me that one.
Thanks.
Here you go, Zeb.
Huh?
Do you like that?
Huh?
We're going to
get you home, Zeb.
OK?
All right, come on.
You're a handsome
old man, huh.
Elliot?
Macray!
Macray, it's Harry.
They're all gone.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, old man.
Macray, we've got
to get out of here.
I-- I was wrong, Harry.
I was dead wrong.
About what?
A man doesn't
become what he thinks.
He becomes what he does.
He becomes what he does.
He becomes what he does.
Macray!
Quick.
Harry!
I know the way.
This way now.
So why don't youstep inside, and then I--
I'll have another look at it.
Won't go outside.
Won't leave the room.
Most days he won't
even get off bed.
Just lies there.
Doesn't let any of it out.
What those poor boys
had to go through.
How can I help him?
Does he speak?
Little, not much.
About?
His friend, mostly,
the one who was killed.
Macray.
And sometimes at night,
he whispers a name.
His mother or
girlfriend, I suppose.
Do you know her, sir?
Who's that?
Winnie.
What's that?
Look!
What the-- What's
that doing here?
Gah, keep it away!
Gracious!
You might as well--
What is it?
What on earth!
Visitor for you,
Captain Colebourn.
Winnie!
It's you.
Look at you.
You got so big.
You got so big.
Hey, Winnie.
Hey, Winnie.
Good girl.
Yeah, good girl.
Good girl.
Yeah?
It's a remarkable bear!
Wave for Harry?
Missed you so much.
I missed you.
Good bear.
Shh.
There's a good bear.
It's all over.
It's hard to imagine.
- You can go home.
- Home.
Winnie too, but this
time, not in my trunk.
Thank you, sir.
You did a
hell of a job, Harry.
You all did.
Fine brave hearts,
every one of you.
Thank you, General.
Transfer's all
in order, Captain.
Inoculation jabs,
delousing, and so forth.
Oh, the blue one you have toshow to immigration in Canada.
Shouldn't be a problem,
though, should it?
Of course, she's a
Canadian citizen.
Thank you very
much, Mr. Protheroe.
I'm very grateful for
everything you've done.
Grateful?
That's a.
Grateful.
She's the most infamous
animal in our keep, sir.
A fair bit of human
companionship,
I think that's how you put it.
Do you remember?
Ha!
I mean, look at them.
They can't keep away from her.
Horrible little hatchlings.
Overrun the entire
area, they do.
They come in droves.
And on Sundays, well, it
taxes a Christian heart.
Need a herd dog
to get them away.
I love my zoo, understand.
It's just those pesky little--
yes, well--
--it's not
an issue anymore, is it?
Mr. Protheroe, what
would you say if--
what I'm thinking
is Winnie seems
to have find herself a home.
Home?
Here, at the zoo.
You can see how she adores them.
Them?
What do you mean--
Oh no, no, no.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.
You can't go back on your word.
Besides, I've already
given you the--
the paper--
No bear could be better lovednor have a greater purpose.
The bear is not the problem.
It's them.
They-- They drop
their sticky wrappers.
They-- They kick up a ruckus.
They-- They scare the monkeys.
Animals are one thing kept, butthose sticky, thankless vermin.
I'd better say goodbye.
Hey.
I guess this is
it, old girl, huh?
Hmm?
Huh?
You know I'll come back
and see you, don't you?
Hey.
No, I promise.
Why am I telling
you anything, huh?
You're just a bear.
Extraordinary bear.
You know that, don't you?
Huh?
Of course you do.
You know I love you.
Huh?
You'll be fine.
Where do you think shelived before she lived here?
Where do you think, my boy?
Well, I imagine in the woods.
You're probably right.
What did she eat?
Why don't you ask Edward?
He's not Edward.
He's not?
Not anymore.
No?
He's Winnie.
Winnie?
Yes.
There once was a
bear name Winnie.
Who lived in the wood.
And who loved to eat honey.
Honey!"
11,A Beautiful Curse (2021) - full transcript,"On an island struck with a sleeping phenomenon, a rogue visitor falls for one of the inhabitants, not realising the personal danger it brings","This is a public announcement.
All the ferry services
have been suspended.
If you are still on the island,
contact the authorities
at 555-2368.
If you are not able
to quench your thirst,
are feeling tired
or lightheaded,
do not stay by yourself.
Call immediately.
555-2368. We can help.
Let's find us some shelter.
How about there?
No.
Ah, what about there?
Yeah. Looks big.
What do you think?
Looks good, yeah?
Hell-lo?
Let's find you a home.
Yeah...
I'm going to call you Apple.
Stella.
Your name is Stella.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
Coffee.
Yeah, it keeps you awake.
Uh, I'm, uh... I'm... I'm Samuel.
What do you want?
Uh, I just wanted
to introduce myself.
I thought maybe
we could talk about
- what's been happening here.
- What are you doing here?
No one invited you, and you...
You can't just walk in.
Stella, wait!
How do you know my name?
There's still
no logical explanation
for what's happening
to the folks
on the island off
the west coast.
The government
fears the phenomenon
could spread
to the rest of the country.
Entering the area
is strictly forbidden
and could be
extremely dangerous.
In a few moments...
It's time to get up.
What are you doing here?
No one invited you, and you...
You can't just walk in.
Uh, I just
wanted to introduce myself.
I'm, uh... I'm... I'm Samuel.
What do you want?
I thought maybe we could talk
about what's
been happening here.
No one invited you,
and you...
You can't just walk in.
Stella, wait!
How do you know my name?
Did anyone see you walk in here?
I don't think so.
You don't think so?
Who are you?
I'm a photographer.
I've been, um,
sent here to document
what's been happening here.
You're here for money?
Sneaking around
and taking pictures.
If I could've
asked permission, I would've.
I was the last one to be hit.
Who was the first?
The piano teacher.
She used to call the numbers
at the village hall on Sundays
'cause Bingo is pretty popular
around here.
And, uh, right in the middle of
reading out a card, she just...
fell asleep.
What did people do?
That must've been, like, scary.
Mm-hmm.
They called the doctor.
And there's
no indication whatsoever
that there's anything wrong
with her.
Well, apart from
the fact that she's asleep
and no one can
wake her up, of course.
Aye.
That's when
it really got complicated.
Every time
someone who's asleep is moved
even a few meters
from where they fell asleep...
their pulse
goes up dramatically.
Like, really dramatically.
The authorities told us
that moving them could...
It could cause
their hearts to explode.
But...
that hasn't been reported.
Tick... tick... tick...
Boom!
No one's come up
with a... a logical explanation?
No one has any idea
how it started or how to end it.
It's... No sign of disease on
the sleeping people, no fever.
People don't lose weight.
They don't get bedsores.
They just... they just...
sleep peacefully.
That must have
been really s... scary for you,
seeing people
get hit one by one.
I wasn't scared.
It was just really odd.
Just this, like, calm,
weary feeling took over
more and more and I kept having
these crazy dreams,
and... I felt
just a bit dizzy,
but not in a bad way.
Like...
Like, you know that feeling
when you've smoked a joint and
your body feels all relaxed?
You smoke pot?
Mm-hmm, don't you?
No, no, I barely even drink.
I mean, I might have a beer
if I'm stressed, but no.
Wow. Part-ay.
Mainly I remember
getting really, really thirsty,
but no matter how much
I drank, I couldn't quench it.
And these really weird
dreamy hallucinations.
But mainly I remember
getting more and more thirsty.
Do you know... do you...
What do you think it is?
You wanna know what I think?
Maybe everyone just watched
the same boring TV show
too many times.
Maybe...
This is a public announcement.
If you are still on the island,
contact the authorities
at 555-2368.
It is extremely dangerous
for you to stay here.
In a statement today,
the prime minister
promised more resources
to the authorities trying to
solve the mysterious phenomenon
on the island
off the west coast.
The government fears
the phenomenon could spread
to the rest of the country,
and authorities
are patrolling the area
from the ground and the air
to make sure
no one enters the island.
I have to leave.
And, uh, I'm sorry.
It's too risky for me to stay.
Are you
afraid of getting infected?
More of a hygiene thing.
I'm actually almost never ill
because I... I keep
my hands clean.
Well, you can get sick
from being afraid
of getting sick,
did you know that?
What exactly are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
Um, I'm here on
a photography assignment.
Yeah, I know,
but why are you really here?
Um...
I c...
I, um...
I didn't just come here
to take pictures.
I, uh,
uh, also came here...
for... you.
Yeah.
Um, no, I, um...
I came at, um... last summer.
I was actually here
with some friends.
I, uh, saw you
in the supermarket.
Okay.
Yeah, um, um, you were so, um...
What was I?
Um, photogenic?
As pretty as a picture?
Um, well, I don't know.
You were so, like, um...
Yeah, it's difficult to explain.
You had a sort of energy about
you, like, um, you know, cool.
I don't know. Like, I just
guess... I guess I wanted to,
uh, get to know you somehow.
I actually saw you later.
Uh, I went out for some food
with some friends.
Uh, the restaurant
was full of people,
and, uh, you actually sat
over there.
Yeah, right there. And I... I sat
here at this table.
And you were having...
You were having fun.
You were laughing and
joking and throwing things.
And I was... I actually wanted
to come over and talk to you.
You know, it could've been fun.
Why didn't you?
I actually... I planned to.
I thought I'd do it after
you finished your mains,
and then after your desserts,
and then after you fin...
You know, paid the bill,
and by that time it was, uh...
It was too late.
So, what stopped you?
Shit...
Good morning.
How are ya?
Self-service today?
Yeah? Okay.
Let me see. Ah.
But, you know,
if you had risked it
and come over,
what would you have said?
Um... well, I su...
I suppose I would have,
uh, introduced myself,
and, uh, been like, ""Hey, um,
do you wanna grab
some coffee sometime?""
Oh, wow, coffee.
Oh, God.
That sounds epic.
No, or, you know, have pizza
in a restaurant, I dunno.
What... Would you have said...
...yeah?
Amazing Things: tape number one.

Um, I dunno.
Wake up, come on!
I thought
I was the one sleeping here.
- Do you have a car?
- I don't have a car.
- Oh.
- Let's find one.
- No. No, no, no.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Hey, you can't steal a car.
- Come on!
- Stella.
You can't steal a car!
Oh, look what we have here.
Samuel, what do you think?
Nah, looks a bit dull,
doesn't it?
Hey, what about this one?
Samuel?
Come on over.
We just need something
with a bit more... power.
- Power?
- Style.
- Style?
- Bit classier?
Right. Style.
Ha-ha-ha!
There we go.
That is the one for us.
What do you think?
I think we should take

Let's take it.
Aw, it's locked.
That's a shame.
Oh, what a shame.
Let's go and walk, come on.
We need the keys,

This way.
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not!
- No, no.
- Come on!
- Stella. No, no.
- Samuel.
Don't be such a wimp, come on!
Stella...
Hello?
Wow, this place is,
uh... is pretty minimalist.
Come on.
Do you know him?
Not really, but I... I've
seen him in the supermarket.
Are we allowed to be here?
Coming from you?
Seriously?
Hey, dude, we're just
going to borrow your car,
but we're going to take
really good care of it.
Samuel, is he a jacket type,
a dresser type
or a kitchen counter type?
What do you mean?
Where does he put the keys?
Ah, I'm going to go find them.
Have you found them?
Are those his?
Yeah!
You wouldn't have thought, huh?
You can't just take his things.
Who cares?
You know, maybe
he's actually a jacket type.
Bingo!
No...
Do you know what, Samuel?
What?
Let's get killed.
I don't have a license.
Not bad, huh?
No, it's nice.
The sun is so nice.
Do you know that feeling
when you have cold toes
and a warm face?
I always have cold toes.
- Now you wanna take a photo?
- Yeah.
Unbelievable.
Have I told you you've
got a really photogenic face?

Stuff that I dream of.
To feel less vulnerable.
To ride a flamingo.
A furry friend.
A constant smile to look at.
Getting a letter
from a stranger.
Less loneliness.
To be able to be invisible.
To find someone to really trust.
I, uh... I read this story...
This sort of ancient story
about how long,
long, long, long ago,
humans lived as one piece.
Two souls formed as one,
woven together.
Together, the soul
was incredibly powerful,
and they were challenging the
gods, and then Zeus comes down.
And he, um...
He cuts them in half,
and he separates them.
And so, they live separately,
and that's why
we talk about, um,
trying to find your other half.
Do you think
there's one person for everyone?
I'd like to think so.
But how do you know
if you've found the right one?
I guess you just feel it.
I dunno.
Have you?
Found the right one?
Um...
Have you?
I thought I had once, but...
Now I'm just happy
being by myself.
I just want you to wake up.
I just want to meet you.
I want you to wake up.
This is a public announcement.
If you are not able
to quench your thirst,
are feeling tired...
...or lightheaded,
do not stay by yourself.
Contact the authorities
at 555-2368.
It is extremely dangerous
for you to stay here.
Hey.
Hey, buddy!
Hey, hey, Apple!
Look what I got for you
in the supermarket.
Yeah.
Dinner, hey?
Come on.
Okay. Hey!
Yeah, do you like your plant?
Lasagna!
Voila.
After you, sir, thank you.
Cheers!
Mm-hmm.
Beer in a wine glass.
Yeah.
Hey, hello. Hey, you.
So, I went to
the, uh, supermarket today,
and I picked up
all of your ingredients...
You think you know me,
but you don't.
Okay.
I feel like, um, I do.
In some ways.
Tape number two:
Not So Amazing Things.
I don't feel I'm good enough.
I'm lonely,
even with other people.
The antique pictures I buy
from the flea market
because they help me feel
like I have a real family.
My parents told me
my grandfather died
before I was born.
They don't know
I know he's still alive.
You can't get to know
someone by going
through their stuff
and watching them sleep.
What do you... I don't
know what you want me to...
What do you want me to do?
I feel like I...
want to know everything
about you.
But that's what I feel,
and I don't know why,
and that's what... um,
that's what I've got to do.
I want to know
everything about you.
I don't think
that's such a good idea.
I think you can, uh,
learn a lot about somebody...
by not just listening
to what they tell you...
but by hearing
what's under the words.
I find it hard to surrender.
I don't feel beautiful.
You don't even know me.
I wish I never came here.
Well, what's stopping
you from leaving?
Fuck off. Fuck off!
What are you talking about?
I would be way too much for you.
Yeah, I think you would.
Okay, well, I guess that's it.
Yeah, I guess
this will never work.
Bye, then.
I have a good feeling.
Okay...
Shit...
- Samuel?
- Hey.
I've been thinking.
I don't think
I can change for you.
I've been... I've been thinking,
too. You shouldn't have to.
I am who I am.
I like who you are.
But you've only imagined me.
I think this can work.
How?
We don't even know each other.
I'll show you.
But what if you fall asleep?
The longer you stay here, the
more likely you are to be hit.
I can't tell you what to do.
You don't have to.
I just want you to know...
no one has ever made me feel
the way you make me feel.
You make me feel so happy.
You make me feel so free.
You do that.
You, um...
I'm just...
I'm just scared...
that... we will... never meet.
It's time
to decide how this goes.
Oh, fuck.
Mainly I remember
being really, really thirsty.
But no matter how much
I drank, I couldn't quench it.
I'm not leaving.
Ow.
Hello?
Um...
Hey.
Hello?
Hey?
Hey!
Come on.
Hey! Wake up!
This isn't real.
Uh, did you put that
on my picture?
Okay. I'm just gonna
let you... stay there.
Hey, did you
eat all of my apples?
Hey!
Oh, what?
Okay, now I have a fish?
Hey, did you make this?
It's pretty good.
Have you been
looking in my diary?
You... You listened
to my tapes?
The fuck is wrong with you!
Why did you do that?
Fucking hell.
Now it's my turn
to really get to know you.
Have you ever been
caught masturbating?
- Uh, what? Um, no...
- Clock's ticking!
Okay, um, have I... Yes, I have.
- By who?
- Um...
Uh, my mom.
- Where?
- Where?
In my garage.
If a family
member needed a kidney
and you were the only match,
would you give one up?
Would you give one up?
Depends on who.
- Your father?
- Difficult.
- Mother?
- Absolutely.
Have you ever killed an animal?
Never.
Do you ever
rehearse a phone call
before making it?
Um, yeah. Um, well,
it depends on
who I'm talking to.
Let's say me.
Then I would definitely
rehearse it.
Do you have many friends?
Do you feel alone?
Not right now.
Have you ever been in love?
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Samuel.
I'm Stella."
12,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019) - full transcript,Based on the true story of a real-life friendship between Fred Rogers and journalist Lloyd Vogel.,"âª It's a beautiful day
in this neighborhood âª
âª A beautiful day for a neighbor âª
âª Would you be mine?
Could you be mine? âª
âª It's a neighborly day
in this beauty wood âª
âª A neighborly day for a beauty âª
âª Would you be mine?
Could you be mine? âª
âª I have always wanted to have
a neighbor just like you âª
âª I've always wanted to live
in a neighborhood with you âª
âª So, let's make the most
of this beautiful day âª
âª Since we're together
we might as well say âª
âª Would you be mine?
Could you be mine? âª
âª Won't you be my neighbor? âª
âª Won't you please?
Won't you please? âª
âª Please won't you be my neighbor? âª
Hello neighbor.
So good to see you again today.
Did you see the...
What special thing
I brought in to show you?
It's called a picture board.
Because behind each one of these
little doors is a picture of people.
Lady Aberlin.
Let's see
who's behind this door.
It's King Friday the thirteenth,
with his crown and
mustache and beard.
Who's behind here?
It's Mister McFeely.
He always says ""speedy delivery"",
doesn't he?
I'd like you to meet
a new friend of mine.
His name is Lloyd Vogel.
Someone has hurt my friend Lloyd.
And not just on his face.
He is having a hard time
forgiving the person who hurt him.
Do you know
what that means, to forgive?
It's a decision we make
to release a person from the feelings
of anger we have at them.
It's strange, but sometimes
it's hardest of all
to forgive someone we love.
Let's go say hello
to my new friend Lloyd,
shall we?
âª I never felt magic crazy as this âª
âª I never saw moons
knew the meaning of the sea âª
âª I never held emotion
in the palm of my hand âª
âª Or felt sweet breezes
in the top of a tree âª
âª But now you're here âª
âª Brighten my northern sky âª
Here to present this year's
award for Feature Writing.
Please welcome
last year's winner Lloyd Vogel.
Thank you.
It's so wonderful to be among
so many of my fellow misfits tonight.
So, why do we write
for magazines for a living?
Honestly, because doing anything else
doesn't seem quite like living at all.
We get a front row seat to history.
We get to expose the truth
that others cannot see.
And sometimes, just sometimes,
we get to change a broken world
with our words.
Thank you. I needed this.
I ate a block of cheese for dinner.
So, what are we forgetting?
We definitely need more diapers.
More than this?
We're going to Jersey for one night.
We go through at least
twelve a day.
We do?
What are you feeding that kid?
Wouldn't it be easier
if we left him with a sitter?
You know I'm not ready to leave him
with a stranger, okay?
He's too little.
Yeah.
Hey, your sister called last night.
She wanted to make sure
you'd written your toast.
Oh, I'm all set. I'm just gonna use
my speech from her first wedding.
- Or maybe from her second.
- Oh, yeah! Just change the names.
And hey, she wanted
me to tell you something.
Okay...
Your father is coming.
I guess she reached out to him a couple
of months ago, and he didn't respond,
but, then he called,
and now he's coming to the wedding.
Are you okay?
Yeah! I'm fine.
But I don't think we should go.
- Lloyd!
- What?
Seriously, why have a baby if you can't
use him to get out of social obligations?
This is what Lorraine was afraid of,
that you would back out.
I'm kidding.
I'm not gonna miss her wedding.
I look forward to them every year.
Okay.
I think it'll be nice for Gavin
to meet his grandfather.
Sure.
Dammit!
Daddy's just being funny.
Daddy's being funny.
That's impossible.
Here. Take him. Here.
There.
Great.
He looks terrified.
He should be.
He's marrying Lorraine.
Oh my God! You look beautiful.
Absolutely.
Well, I'm ten pounds short
of my target weight, but whatever.
Lloyd. The brother.
I know, man. I guess I'm Todd,
you know, the husband.
And look at you, ya little peanut.
I don't think we're having any kids.
How did that happen?
I invited him and he came.
To walk you down the aisle? Really?
He offered. He missed the first two,
I thought ""why the hell not?"".
I can think of a few reasons why.
He's old, and if he's gonna try
to make an effort...
Oh, I guess it's time
we get this started.
So, in lieu of the typical father of
the bride speech, I thought I'd...
Well, I'd like to sing a little ditty.
This is for my Lorraine
and for you too...
And for Todd.
âª I know I stand in line until you think you
have the time to spend an evening with me âª
âª And if we go some place to dance, I know that
there's a chance you won't be leaving with me âª
âª Then afterwards we drop into a quiet
little place and have a drink or two âª
Admit it.
Now you wish we hadn't eloped.
He's drunk.
Oh, well. He can sing.
âª I love you âª
âª I love you âª
âª I love you âª
Here we are.
In the pearl of the Garden State.
Hello, Jerry.
Oh, come on!
You don't have to call me Jerry.
Or call me Jerry.
I don't care.
And hello to you!
Hi, I'm Andrea. Lloyd's wife.
Andrea! Of course!
What a unique pleasure.
Hello, little fella.
This is Gavin.
What a handsome man!
You look just like me.
Let's get a drink?
What's this stuff? A pop?
This stuff will kill you.
I'm just giving my toast,
and then we're leaving, so...
Doll, could you give us a moment?
She's not a doll.
She's a public interest attorney.
Where the money in that?
You know what?
We're gonna circulate.
You got a baby. And a wife.
You happy?
I'm happy.
Well, she seems nice enough, but
I mean, aren't you a little old
to have a baby?
I'm not that old.
You're smart.
Your mom and I hardly knew
each other when she got pregnant.
We were babies.
Don't talk about her!
Wait a minute.
You don't know the whole story.
Your mom really was not the saint...
Don't talk about my mom!
- Come on?
- Get off me!
What the hell?
You didn't hear him.
You were out of control.
He was out of control!
You just not gonna take
responsibility for any of this?
Of course, I am! I offered to
pay for Lorraine's dry cleaning.
Have you ever felt
the way Lloyd does?
So angry you want
to hurt someone?
Or at yourself?
I know I have.
When I was a boy
I was very chubby.
And the other kids would chase me
and call me names, like ""Fat Freddy"".
It made me very sad.
Sometimes, when I was by myself,
I would cry.
And other times,
it made me very angry.
There is always something
you can do with the mad that you feel.
Did you hear that?
Someone is at my door.
Let's go see who it is.
It's Mr. McFeely.
Speedy delivery.
Look. It's a magazine.
Thank you.
Magazines are always
so full of interesting information.
They sure are.
My friend Lloyd works for a magazine.
He's a very wonderful writer.
That reminds me.
I have a video I found, and I thought
you and your neighbor may like to see it.
What is it?
It's about how people
make a magazine.
It's called ""How People Make a Magazine"".
I know lots of people like magazines, so
I thought you might find this interesting.
I think we would, but do you have
time to show it to us now?
I'd be glad to see it again.
Let's look at it on Picture Picture.
We'll watch it on Picture Picture
and see how people
make a magazine.
Now, this is the ink they use in the
printing press that prints the magazines.
Yellow ink. It looks like mustard.
And these are large rolls of blank paper,
that are getting loaded into the machine.
I wonder how many magazines they can make
out of one of those large rolls.
They print the magazines in giant sheets.
One color at a time.
This machine assembles the magazine,
and glues it all together.
Oh, now, who's this?
These are the people who decide
what will be in the magazine.
They pick the pictures
and design the layout.
Oh, that's an important job.
And these are the people who write
the words that go into a magazine.
It's a lot of work
to make a magazine, isn't it?
It certainly is.
Yeah.
Pay no attention to my face. Softball injury.
Nothing to worry about. Good morning, Ellen.
How are you?
- This should be interesting.
- What should?
Sending you on an assignment
with your face all busted up.
- An assignment?
- Yep.
You're the perfect person for it.
You just had a baby.
Why are you giving me
an assignment?
We're doing an issue
on heroes, and we're
profiling a number of inspirational people.
We just need a small piece of copy to
accompany a pretty photo.
You hired me as an investigative
journalist. I don't do puff pieces.
Wait a second, didn't I hire you
to do whatever I tell you to do?
And right now that's doing a profile
on one of our nation's heroes.
Who?
Mister Rogers.
As in the hokey kid's show guy?
As in the beloved
children's television host, yes.
Look, I think
this could help you, Lloyd.
Just, start to change your image.
I don't need to change my image.
Okay.
Ellen?
He was the only person on our list
willing to be interviewed by you, Lloyd.
I guess you're developing a reputation.
A reputation? People love talking to me.
Yeah, they do. Until they read
what you write about them.
So what? I'm supposed to go easy
on this guy because he
plays with puppets for a living?
400 words. Play nice.
Hello, this is Lloyd Vogel,
from Esquire Magazine.
I'm calling to schedule an interview
with Mister Rogers.
Sorry about your face.
You know, I got it good too.
Look, I messed this up.
I just want to talk to you.
We have a lot that needs to be said.
No. I'm not gonna be ambushed.
Come on, Lloyd.
Hi, honey.
- Hi. Hi guys.
- Hi, Lloyd.
Smells in here.
Bathroom trash.
Nine different types of diapers.
Hey, Lloyd.
I got it.
Hello?
Lloyd?
Who's this?
This is Fred Rogers.
Hi. That was quick.
Well, I figured if you want to talk to me,
I should want to talk to you.
Yeah, I just wanted to set a time to sit
with you and ask you a few questions.
I'm happy to schedule something,
except for one thing.
What's that?
You have me here right now.
Okay. Sure.
On our program, I try to look through the
camera into the eyes of a single child,
and speak to him,
or her, trying to be
fully present to their feelings
and their needs.
Right.
Do you know what the important thing
in the world is to me right now?
No.
Talking on the telephone
to Lloyd Vogel.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
I got an assignment.
Where are you going this time?
Pittsburgh, tomorrow.
I'm profiling Mister Rogers.
Really?
I love him.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Why?
I don't know.
Wait, Ellen is giving you a profile?
She knows that's not what you do.
I think that's her point.
Can you say no?
Can you take some time
and be with us for a while?
You didn't take off any time
when Gavin was born.
Not really.
At least it's someone good.
Yeah.
We'll see.
Oh God, Lloyd.
Please don't ruin my childhood.
Hey, I'm looking for Fred Rogers.
Who?
Am I in the wrong place?
I know who you are. In here.
You'll get about twenty minutes
with him during the break.
I was told an hour.
You're not gonna
try to fight him, are you?
Oh, softball league.
Play at the plate.
Maybe you shouldn't have led
with your face.
Sorry, guy. Could be a minute.
Is this a Make-a-Wish thing?
How are we doing, Margy?
He's ruining my life.
How long?
Half-hour already, which puts us...
73 minutes behind. Yikes.
I gotta go in. Cover me.
You're on your own.
...color of sweater that I do, but I can't
see colors very well, isn't that funny?
Look at that.
I'm sorry.
Son, he's talking to you.
All right.
Don't do that, sweetheart.
That sword looks awfully sharp,
and heavy too.
- Not really.
- No?
Well, you must be very strong
in order to hold it like that.
And I bet you are very strong
on the inside, too.
Oh, I'd love that.
I'm terribly sorry, Fred.
We need to start.
Can I take your picture?
Everybody make sure you can see me.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for coming down
and visiting us in the neighborhood.
Folks, if you'll follow me.
How often does this happen?
Every day.
Okay here we go!
Everybody settle.
Quiet please.
Roll sound.
- Sound speeds.
- Mark it.
And, action.
Do you know what this is?
It's... Lloyd!
Lloyd!
Hold please!
We can't fire him, can we?
Hello, Lloyd.
It's nice to meet you.
Are you all right?
Play at the plate.
It looks like it hurts.
Let's chat afterwards?
- We need to keep moving.
- We could have Evan take look at him?
No, I'm good.
I'm sorry, Fred,
we need to...
Okay, all right.
It's wonderful to meet you, I'm so glad
you're here, Lloyd, I'm looking forward to
talking with you. I truly am.
After this.
Everyone, this is Lloyd Vogel.
He is a wonderful writer.
Thank you, Fred.
Okay, resetting.
Step over here.
Roll sound.
Sound speeds.
And slate.
And action!
Do you know what this is?
It's a tent.
Let's set it up.
Mercy.
Little bit trickier than I thought.
I can't.
I can't do it.
It must take two grown-ups
to set up a tent.
And that's a cut. Let's go again.
No, let's...
Let's look at that.
Okay, roll playback, please.
You know, we could pre-set
a tent for you.
No, I think this is good.
Yeah.
I think we're okay.
Good, that's lunch everybody.
The tent. Why didn't you let them
set it up for you?
Children need to know that
even when adults make plan,
sometimes, they don't turn out
the way we'd hoped.
How long have you been married, Lloyd?
Eight years.
That's a wonderful accomplishment.
Does your spouse have a name?
Andrea.
I would like to meet
Andrea some day.
I'm sure.
You've lived in Pittsburgh
your whole life?
I grew up not too far from here
in a town called Latrobe,
but we've lived here for quite some time,
and we've raised our boys here.
Do you think living here makes it easier
or more difficult to be a celebrity?
Celebrity? Mercy.
You don't consider yourself famous?
Fame is a four letter word,
like tape, or zoom, or face.
What ultimately matters
is what we do with it.
And what are you doing with it?
We are trying to give children
positive ways
to deal with their feelings.
This piece will be for an issue
about heroes.
Do you consider yourself a hero?
I don't think of myself as a hero.
No, not at all.
What about ""Mister Rogers""?
Is he a hero?
I don't understand the question.
There's you, Fred, and then there's
the character you play, Mister Rogers.
You said it was a play at the plate.
Is that what happened to you?
What did happened to you, Lloyd?
I got into a fight.
Oh my.
Who did you get into a fight with?
It's not important.
Jerry.
And who is Jerry?
My father.
Oh my.
I'd rather not talk about it.
What were you and your father
fighting about?
I'm here to interview you, Mr. Rogers.
Well, that is what we're doing,
isn't it?
We're ready for you
in studio B, Fred.
Okay, Margy.
I thought we had twenty minutes.
Can I take your picture? I like to
take pictures of people that I meet
so then I can show them
to Joanne later on.
Thank you so much.
I do hope you'll stick around. I really do.
That's it?
Daniel, are you set?
I'm set.
Thank you, Daniel.
Did she just talk to the puppet?
Daniel isn't just a puppet.
Daniel is Fred, and Fred is Daniel.
You mean...
Please stop talking.
Let me know
when you're ready, Lattie.
Okay. Thank you.
And Trolley. Action.
Hello, Lady Aberlin.
Hi, Daniel.
Are you making that funny smell?
Do you mean
that skunk kinda smell?
No, I'm trying to help
that smell go away.
By squirting another smell?
That's right. A sweet smelling smell.
Wanna smell?
Okay.
That does smell good.
Where did the bad smell come from?
Mister Skunk.
He got scared, and he just sprayed
this smell all over me.
Oh no! Did he say he was sorry?
No.
And that just makes me
so very mad!
And I don't know what to do.
Oh, Daniel.
âª What do you do with the mad
that you feel? âª
âª When you feel so mad
you could bite âª
âª When the whole wide world
seems oh so wrong âª
âª And nothing you do
seems very right âª
âª What do you do? Do you punch a bag? âª
âª Do you pound some clay
or some dough? âª
âª Do you round up friends for a
game of tag or see how fast you go? âª
âª I can stop when I want to.
Can stop when I wish âª
âª Can stop, stop, stop anytime âª
âª And what a good feeling
to feel like this âª
âª And know that the feeling
is really mine âª
âª Know that there's something deep inside
that helps us become what we can âª
âª For a girl can be someday be a woman âª
âª And a boy can be someday a man âª
Thank you, Lady Aberlin.
Thank you, Daniel.
- I feel better.
- I'm so glad.
I just don't know if he's for real.
That's not for you to say, Lloyd.
I think with a few more interviews...
No, no, no. I told you,
this isn't an exposÃ©, okay?
Just, please, put pen to paper. A couple
of funny anecdotes. Keep it simple.
I can't do that, Ellen.
He's a lot more complex than I thought.
He's a children's entertainer.
He's Mister freaking Rogers.
This isn't Mikhail Gorbachev
we're talking about.
I don't think you understand
what you're asking of me.
I'm asking you to do your job,
Now, get out of here and come back to me
when you have your first draft.
This gives new meaning
to ""boys in the hoooood"".
We'll be back with Mister Rogers!
- Hey.
- Hi.
How'd it go?
He's just about the nicest person
I've ever met.
When you say it it doesn't sound
like a compliment.
There is an attitude out there, there are some
things going on, there's a lot of hopelessness.
What do we need to do?
There are no simple answers, of course,
but if we could, through television programs,
as well as every other imaginable program,
let people know that
each one of us is precious.
It all starts in the home. We can
never underrate how important that is.
I don't think that anybody can grow unless
he really is accepted exactly as he is.
If somebody is always saying to a child
""you're gonna grow up
and you're gonna be fine"".
So much of that in this country already.
- It's your turn.
- Yup.
A child is appreciated for what
he ""will be"", not for what he ""is"".
He will be a great consumer someday.
So, the quicker we can get them out of
the nest, so they can go out and buy,
then the better.
What do you think is the biggest mistake
parents make in raising their children?
Not to remember their old childhood.
Yeah.
I think that the best thing
that we can do is to
think about what it was like for us,
and know what our children
are going through.
But you know what, it's so hard
once you get to be a parent, you always say
""I will never do this"", when your mother's doing
it to you or your father's doing it to you.
You say ""I will never do this to my child"".
And then you get to our age,
and you forget what it was like
to be this size, you really do forget.
But those children can help
re-evoke what it was like.
That's why when you're a parent
you have a new chance to grow.
You do?
Did you ever, I can't imagine,
I know that you are the father of two boys,
but I can't imagine you ever having a problem
with your children. You ever have any?
Well, of course, I'm a human being,
just like everybody else...
I thought you would just talk to them
and say ""Can you say good morning""?
And they would change.
But, you know, a lot of people
do those parodies...
âª Well I left my happy home
to see what I could find out âª
âª I left my folk and friends
with the aim to clear my mind out âª
âª Well I hit the rowdy road
and many kinds I met there âª
âª And many stories told me
on the way to get there âª
âª So on and on I go,
the seconds tick the time out âª
âª So much left to know,
and I'm on the road to find out âª
Hello.
Oh my, I woke you.
Is this Andrea?
Yes?
This is Fred Rogers.
- Oh hi!
- Who is it?
Uh, Lloyd's right here.
Andrea, while I have you, I just want to
thank you so much for sharing Lloyd with us.
It can't be easy him traveling
with Gavin at home.
Thank you for saying that.
I'm gonna give Lloyd to you now.
Mister Rogers knows my name!
This is Lloyd.
You left without
getting to say goodbye,
so I'm glad we get to continue to talk.
I'm going to New York City today to film,
and Joanne is coming with me.
We thought you might like
to come down and say hello.
How much time do you think
I'll have with him today?
You're here because
Fred wants you here.
Honored.
He likes everybody,
but he loves people like you.
People like me?
I've read your work.
You don't really care
for humanity, do you?
I'm just doing my job.
I insisted he read you
before we agreed.
And did he?
Every article we could find.
Oh thank you.
That made me wanna get up
and do a little dance.
We have a surprise
for you, Mister Rogers.
We gonna play one of your songs,
called ""You are Special"".
How wonderful!
How do you play your instruments
without your bows?
Well, we can play pizzicato, which means we're
going to pluck the strings with our fingers.
Hello everybody.
Nice to see you.
I call this move
the handshake hand off.
That's quite a skill.
We stole Bill from the
governor's office fourteen years ago.
Have you got a chance
to know him yet?
Love Bill. Big fan.
He is very protective of Roge.
You call him Roge?
I don't call him Mister Rogers
at home, dear.
Joanne Rogers.
- Nice to meet you.
- You as well, dear.
How does it feel to be married
to a living saint?
I'm not fond of that term.
If you think of him as a saint,
then his way of being is unattainable.
He works at it all the time.
It's a practice.
He's not a perfect person.
He has a temper.
He chooses how he
responds to that anger.
That must take a lot of effort.
Well, he does things every day
that help ground him.
Reads scripture, swims laps.
Prays for people by name.
Writes letters, hundreds of them.
He's been doing that since I met him.
Thank you so much.
Thank you folks for coming out.
- My love.
- Bye, my love.
We'll see you in just a few hours.
Lloyd, I thought you and I
would spend some time together.
Of course.
Do you always take the subway?
Joanne and I have an apartment.
It's just a few stops away.
It's the easiest way
to get around sometimes.
You've covered some heavy stuff,
especially for a show aimed at children.
I'm glad you had a chance
to view the program.
Death, divorce, war. It gets dark.
You know,
Maggie Stewart showed me
the most beautiful word in sign language.
Do you know what that means?
It means ""friend"".
Isn't that perfect?
Who's Maggie Stewart?
Hey Mister Rogers.
âª It's a beautiful day
in this neighborhood âª
âª A beautiful day for a neighbor âª
âª Would you be mine?
Could you be mine? âª
âª It's a neighborly day
in this beautywood âª
âª A neighborly day for a beauty âª
âª Would you be mine?
Could you be mine? âª
âª I have always wanted
to have a neighbor just like you âª
âª I've always wanted to live
in a neighborhood with you âª
âª So, let's make the most
of this beautiful day âª
âª Since we're together,
we might as well say âª
âª Would you be mine?
Could you be mine? âª
âª Won't you be my neighbor? âª
âª Won't you please?
Won't you please? âª
âª Please won't you be my neighbor? âª
That was wonderful.
It seems like all these people
line up to tell you their problems.
Isn't it wonderful? Such bravery.
It seems like that would be
an incredible burden on you.
I'm grateful for you
saying that, Lloyd.
I'm grateful for your compassion.
Is it a burden on you?
Okay. Let's assume
it's a burden on you.
There's no normal life
that is free from pain.
How do you deal with that?
There are many ways you can deal
with your feelings without
hurting yourself or anybody else.
Yeah, like what?
You can pound a lump of clay.
Or swim as fast as you can swim.
Or play the lowest keys on the piano
all at the same time.
Did you ever talk to anyone
about the burden you carry?
Would you like to meet
my special puppet friends
from The Neighborhood of Make Believe?
They look like they've seen
better days.
They've been with me
for quite a while.
You ever think about swapping them out,
getting new ones?
Didn't you have a special friend
when you were very young, Lloyd?
- A special friend?
- Special toy.
Or a stuffed animal
that you loved very much,
even as it got ratty and worn-out,
it made you just love it all the more?
I don't know, I'm sure I did.
Can you tell me
about your special friend?
I think I had a rabbit.
Did your rabbit have a name?
It was just rabbit.
It was Old Rabbit.
And who gave you Old Rabbit?
My mom.
She must love you very much.
That she did.
She died when I was young.
I'm sure that if she saw you today,
the person you have become,
she would be proud of you.
I want to get back to my questions.
You wanted to meet my special friends
from the Neighborhood of Make Believe.
No. I asked about the burden you carry.
I am King Friday the thirteenth.
Lloyd Vogel the journalist,
I presume?
And here's Daniel Striped Tiger.
Sometimes, Daniel is too shy to talk.
But that's okay, Daniel.
Have you met Daniel?
Not officially. No.
I'd like to meet Old Rabbit.
I don't wanna talk
about Old Rabbit, I gotta say.
Maybe Lloyd doesn't feel
like talking today, Daniel.
And that's okay.
Can you put
the puppet down, Fred?
You stopped making the show
in the mid-seventies for three years.
Why'd you quit?
At that point I felt the program
had covered all the major
facets of childhood.
And what brought you back?
Money? Boredom?
My sons had grown into teenagers.
And were struggling.
We all were.
I realized then that there were
still much more to talk about.
I can't imagine it was easy,
growing up with you as a father.
Until recently, my oldest
never told people about me.
He's very private,
and that's okay.
And my younger son,
he genuinely tested me.
But, eventually, we found our way.
And now I'm very proud of both of them.
But you are right, Lloyd.
It couldn't have been
easy on them.
Thank you.
Thank you for that perspective.
You're welcome.
Is that not the answer
you were hoping for?
Being a parent does not mean
being a perfect parent.
You might be experiencing
some of that now, with your son.
I've been thinking a lot
about you and your father.
Did you work out your disagreement?
This is ridiculous.
Lloyd, where are you going?
We're done. Thanks.
It's been a real pleasure.
Mercy.
Hey hey.
C'mon, sit down.
We cooked you some take-out.
They brought pizza.
Lloyd, this is Dorothy.
Hello.
Can't you just say hello?
Where are your manners?
I'm sorry. I think we should go.
I had an idea, okay?
We'd eat some food,
we'd talk like people.
I messed things up
at the wedding.
Of course, you know,
you didn't help, but I get it.
Then, you let me sit out there in my car
on the street for two nights
like I'm homeless,
like I'm some kind of a bum.
- Jerry, you're not helping.
- He won't say a word!
You came here
to introduce me to her?
Dorothy.
Hi, Dorothy.
Hi, Lloyd.
Okay, you did what you came here to do.
Now I want you to leave.
Lloyd!
I may never come back here,
so, please listen to me.
Dorothy and I have been together
and in love for fifteen years.
He left as soon as Mom got sick,
did you know that?
Couldn't even wait
for her to die.
She really didn't want me there.
'Cause you were sleeping around
while she was dying.
I know. I know it!
It took me years
to get myself together.
Dorothy is why I'm standing here.
She helped me grow the hell up.
You know what they tell you
about people, when they are dying?
They tell you it's peaceful.
That they just slip away.
Mom screamed as she went,
did you know that?
She screamed until she passed out.
And then they came in and revived her,
and she went right back to it.
It was just me, Lorraine
and the nurses!
Sign the paperwork.
Pack up the house.
Put her in the ground.
- Jerry.
- Come on, Lloyd.
My jaw.
Jerry.
Jerry!
Oh, Jerry, Oh my God!
- I'll call 911.
- Lloyd, do something!
- Is he breathing?
- Yeah, he's breathing.
Lloyd, do something!
The cardiac MRI revealed
more extensive stenosis than we thought.
An operation at this time...
The risk of infection alone...
You know anything?
I hate hospitals.
You should go home
and get him to bed.
I don't wanna leave you here.
I'm not staying here.
Okay.
Let's all go together.
No. I have to go to Pittsburgh.
Right now?
Yeah, I have to work.
With your dad like this?
I have a deadline.
Yeah, I'm sure Ellen would understand
if you tell her what's happening.
I don't want to.
I wanna go to Pittsburgh.
I wanna do my job.
This shouldn't be a surprise to you.
Don't talk to me like that.
You seem to think that
now that we have a kid
I shouldn't care about all the things
I have always cared about
just because you don't anymore.
Well, I still care about my work.
I have never asked you
to stop caring about your work.
I've gotta go.
Why? Everyone who is important is
in this hospital right now.
Can't you be on my side for once?
You used to be on my side.
I am telling you this
because I am on your side.
Now is not the time to go work.
I gotta go, if I'm gonna make
Pittsburgh by morning.
Fine.
I'm gonna go sit with your family,
while you go.
Pittsburgh?
Lloyd! There you are.
Hey, I need to talk to Fred.
Very funny, mister. Get over there.
We're ready to shoot.
Right this way. Come here.
Quiet please.
What? What am doing here?
You're in this episode, of course.
Just wait there.
- Roll sound.
- Sound speeds.
And slate.
And... Action.
Oh, it's my good friend, Lloyd.
Lloyd Vogel.
- You remember Lloyd?
- Fred, I don't understand what's going on.
Can we stop?
Are you feeling unwell?
Stop asking me questions.
I ask you questions.
On today's program I thought
we would talk about hospitals.
Sometimes when somebody is sick,
- they have to go to a hospital.
- I hate hospitals.
A hospital is a place
where people go.
Okay.
Would you like to pretend
we're at a hospital?
No!
Hello, Old Rabbit.
What?
Old Rabbit, I presume?
I'm not... I don't...
Where's Fred?
I've been waiting to meet you,
Old Rabbit.
I'm so happy you came for a visit.
Hello, Lady Aberlin.
Well hello. Hello, Old Rabbit.
Oh my God.
We were discussing hospitals.
Well, a hospital is where you go
when your body is hurt,
but what do you do
when your feelings are hurt?
Well, you talk about them.
âª It's good to talk. It's good to say âª
- The things we feel.
- What's happening to me?
âª It's good to talk âª
âª We're much more real
without the lock âª
âª It's good to talk âª
Go ahead. Try saying ""I like you"".
I like you.
âª I'm sad âª
I'm sad.
âª I'm angry âª
When did you become angry?
Do you remember?
Did something happen?
Hey peanut.
Hi, Mom.
I know you think
you're doing this for me.
Holding onto this anger.
I don't need it.
Lloyd?
Lloyd?
What happened?
I don't know. He just collapsed.
Is he okay?
Turn.
Oh good, you're awake.
My goodness, if I knew you were there,
I would've stopped all this noise.
No, no. That was beautiful.
You must be very hungry, Lloyd.
Let me get my jacket, and we'll go out.
I should go.
No, nonsense.
Look at this.
Thank you so much.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
Are you a vegetarian?
I just can't imagine
eating anything with a mother.
Bill was right.
You love people like me.
What are people like you?
I've never met anyone
like you in my entire life.
Broken people.
I don't think you are broken.
I know you are a man of conviction.
A person, who knows the difference
between what is wrong, and what is right.
Try to remember
that your relationship with your father
also helped to shape those parts.
He helped you become what you are.
Would you do something
with me, Lloyd?
It's an exercise
I like to do sometimes.
We'll take a minute,
and think about all the people
who loved us into being.
I can't do that.
They will come to you.
Just one minute of silence.
Thank you for doing that with me.
I feel so much better.
So, the way I left...
Was messed up.
Yes. I should've called you.
You shouldn't have left.
The doctor came out to speak to you,
I didn't know what to tell her.
I really didn't know what
to tell your dad.
And on top of that,
I tried to get a cab home,
of course, I couldn't get one,
so had I took a train, at midnight.
People were looking at me
with Gavin like...
Someone was gonna
call Child Services.
I know you're trying to apologize,
but that doesn't mean it gets to be easy.
Okay, talk.
Can we sit?
Is he down?
Finally.
Listen...
I realize I need to deal
with my feelings.
When I'm scared,
which I was in the hospital,
and I...
I have been for a long time,
I get really angry.
And I know it's a way of saying
""I can't deal with this
get away from me"".
But that's not what I want.
That's, actually, the opposite
of what I want.
You and Gavin...
You're what I want.
I'm sorry.
I have to go and see Jerry.
He's dying.
I know.
My dad is dying.
Celia Sherman. Colby Dickerson.
Justin Cook.
Rebecca Aniton.
Lloyd Vogel.
Andrea Vogel.
Gavin Vogel.
Jerry Vogel.
Thank you, God.
He still eats like a teenager.
Cold cuts, sugar cereal.
Stubborn goat.
At least you come by it honestly.
Did you know about
me and my sister?
Not until very recently.
What about my mom?
When he got sick last year,
the first episode, he...
He started to talk,
and tell me things I wish
he'd told me a long time ago.
We got bourbon, you know.
Someone should drink it.
No thanks.
Not even beer?
Do you have a beer? Yeah I...
I'll drink a beer
if it will make you happy.
No. I don't have a beer. And don't
do it because it'd make me happy.
Do it 'cause you wanna do it.
You don't have a beer
and I don't wanna beer.
So, don't drink anything. Dehydrate.
Sorry.
I definitely broke the Pack 'n Play.
It just snapped like a chicken bone.
How is he doing?
He seems fine.
I don't know.
They don't put a hospital bed
in your living room if you're fine.
Hey, thank you for coming.
You're gonna love the sofa bed.
- Yeah?
- No.
Okay. Come here.
I know. I know.
I know, you wish it was your mom
who was awake right now. I know.
But we're gonna let her sleep, okay?
I'm gonna get better at this.
And we're gonna have to
get used to each other.
âª I like you as you are âª
âª Exactly and precisely âª
âª I think you turned out nicely âª
âª I like you as you are âª
âª Without a doubt or question âª
Who's that?
Dorothy?
Come on.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's four in the morning.
I don't sleep much these days.
You don't sleep either, do you?
I never did this with you.
Up in the middle of the night,
doing the mom thing.
It's not a mom thing.
You know what I mean.
You should rest.
No, stay.
Hey.
Right over there.
What?
Just grab two glasses.
I don't think that's the best idea.
How would you know? You don't drink.
Come on.
Now we're talking.
Cheers.
Lloyd.
I am sorry for leaving
you and your sister.
It was selfish. And it was cruel.
Will you look at me?
I am so sorry, son.
It's not fair, you know?
I think I'm just now starting
to figure out how to live my life.
I've always loved you.
I love you too, Dad.
What?
It's stupid.
It's like ten thousand words.
Yeah.
It's not really about
Mister Rogers.
I know.
I mean it is, but it's so you.
You never talk about this stuff.
Nope.
It's good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Lloyd. I love it.
You do?
Yes. It's gonna be the cover.
Right off the bat,
about the wedding...
Whatever, It was the most
entertaining one yet.
I'm just glad you're here.
Don't go to Martha's Vineyard.
Why not?
It's my honeymoon. I deserve it.
Absolutely you do.
No, it's not a question of entitlement.
You're not gonna like it.
It's a buncha rich jerks,
and it's freezing.
You're gonna freeze to death
with a buncha rich jerks.
Who's here?
Ah, I'm in the right place.
- Come on in.
- Lloyd.
Holy crap.
Andrea?
Hi Fred.
Such a pleasure
to finally see you.
- Can I take this for you?
- Oh, thank you.
Hello, Mister Rogers.
Hello.
Hi Gavin, hello, I hope you and I
can be friends someday.
Mr. Vogel.
May I call you Jerry?
Yes sir, you certainly may.
Lloyd, Joanne adored
your article, as did I.
Andrea, are you
feeling better about daycare?
A little. Maybe.
What?
You're not the only one
who talks to Fred.
Mister Rogers, is it true
you are a sharp shooter?
Navy Seal!
No, I'm afraid not.
What, the hell, kind of an insane
question was that?
I heard it.
Andrea, where did you guys go
on your honeymoon?
We eloped in Maui, so we were kinda
already on our honeymoon.
- I would've gone.
- You weren't invited.
Lloyd is embarrassed by us.
- I'm kidding.
- I know.
Maybe, we should do
a family vacation.
What do you think about that, Dad? Should
we dip our toes in the ocean together?
That sounds so nice.
Crash your honeymoon?
Count me in, If I'm still here.
You know, death is something
many of us are uncomfortable
speaking about.
But to die is to be human.
And anything human is mentionable,
anything mentionable is manageable.
Anything mentionable is manageable.
You gotta send me a copy.
Joanne would love this
when she sees it.
It'd be so much cooler
if he was in this.
Thank you.
I should get going.
I'll walk you out.
Count on it.
Thank you.
Hey, what did you say to Jerry?
I asked him to pray for me.
I figure anyone who's going through what he's
going through must be awfully close to God.
- Lloyd.
- Bill.
Read the article.
And?
âª Sometimes people get sad âª
âª And they really do feel bad âª
âª But the very same people
who are sad sometimes âª
âª Are the very same people
who are glad sometimes âª
âª It's funny but it's true âª
âª It's the same, isn't it for me and âª
âª Sometimes people are good âª
âª And they do just what they should âª
âª But the very same people
who are good sometimes âª
âª Are the very same people
who are bad sometimes âª
Maybe, I could slow down
for a few months.
What do you mean?
To stay at home with Gavin.
Let you go back to work,
without having to worry about daycare.
- I want to.
- Really? You?
Gavin and I already discussed that.
We both agree.
I'm so glad I had a chance to tell you
about my friend Lloyd, and his family.
I have a new picture of Lloyd
with his family,
would you like to see it?
There they are.
That's a nice picture.
It gives me a good feeling
to see them all together like that.
I hope you know that you made
today a very special day
by just your being you.
There's no one in the whole world like you,
and I like you just the way you are.
âª It's such a good feeling
to know you're alive âª
âª It's such a happy feeling
you're growing inside âª
âª And when you wake up
ready to say... âª
âª ""I think I'll make
a snappy new day"" âª
âª It's such a good feeling,
a very good feeling âª
âª The feeling you know âª
âª That I'll be back
when the day is new âª
âª And I'll have more ideas for you âª
âª And you'll have things
you'll want to talk about âª
âª I will too âª
See you next time.
And that's a cut!
Thank you.
Okay.
- Great?
- Yeah.
- That's a wrap.
- Thank you.
We're on location tomorrow
at Mister Wagner's shoe shop.
- Call time is 8 AM.
- Thank you all.
ADs have the call sheet.
- Goodnight.
- See you tomorrow.
- Goodnight boss.
- Goodnight.
See you tomorrow."
13,A Beautiful Mind (2001) - full transcript,"From the heights of notoriety to the depths of depravity, John Forbes Nash, Jr. experienced it all. A mathematical genius, he made an astonishing discovery early in his career and stood on the brink of international acclaim. But the handsome and arrogant Nash soon found himself on a painful and harrowing journey of self-discovery. After many years of struggle, he eventually triumphed over his tragedy, and finally - late in life - received the Nobel Prize.","(WHIMSICAL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

Mathematicians won the war.
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes
and built the A-bomb.
Mathematicians, like you.
The stated goal of the Soviets
is global Communism.
In medicine or economics,
in technology or space
battle lines are being drawn.
To triumph, we need results,
publishable, applicable results.
Now who among you

The next Einstein?
Who among you will be
the vanguard of democracy,

Today, we bequeath America's future
into your able hands.
Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.
MAN 1: It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.
MAN 2: No, he has to have it
all for himself.
It's the first time the Carnegie Prize
has been split. Hansen's all bent.
MAN 1: He's got his sights set
on Wheeler Lab,
the new military think-tank at MIT.
They're only taking one this year.
MAN 2: Hansen's used to
being picked first.
MAN 1: Yeah, he's wasted on math.
MAN 2: He should be
running for president.
There could be a mathematical
explanation for how bad your tie is.
(LAUGHS)
NEILSON: Thank you.
Neilson, symbol cryptography.
Neils here broke a Jap code.
Helped rid the world of Fascism.
At least that's what he tells the girls,
eh, Neils?
The name's Bender. Atomic physics.
BENDER: And you are?
SOL: Am I late?
NEILSON: Yes, Mr Sol.
SOL: Oh, good. Hi.
- Sol. Richard Sol.
- MARTIN: The burden of genius.
- There he is.
- So many supplicants, and so little time.
- Mr Sol.
- How are you, sir?
MARTIN: Ah! Bender.
BENDER: Nice to see you.
NEILSON: Congratulations, Mr Hansen.
MARTIN: Thank you.
I'll take another.
Excuse me?
MARTIN: A thousand pardons.
I simply assumed you were the waiter.
- SOL: Play nice, Hansen.
- Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.
MARTIN: An honest mistake.
Well, Martin Hansen.
It is Martin, isn't it?
Why, yes, John, it is.
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.
I've read your preprints, both of them.
The one on Nazi ciphers and
the other one on nonlinear equations.
And I am supremely confident
that there is not a single seminal
or innovative idea in either one of them.
Enjoy your punch.

CHARLES: (COUGHS) Oh, Christ.
The prodigal roommate arrives.
Roommate?
Oh, God, no.
(MUSIC SLOWS TO A STOP)
CHARLES: Did you know that
having a hangover
is not having enough water in your body
to run your Krebs cycle?
Which is exactly what happens to you
when you're dying of thirst.
So, dying of thirst
would probably feel
pretty much like the hangover
that finally bloody kills you.
John Nash?
Hello.
Charles Herman. Pleased to meet you.
PLAYER: All right! Well done!
CHARLES: Well, it's official.
I'm almost human again.
Officer, I saw the driver who hit me.
His name was Johnnie Walker.
Well, I got in last night in time
for English department cocktails.
Cock was mine,
the tail belonged to a particularly
lovely young thing with a passion
for D.H. Lawrence.
You're not easily distracted, are you?
I'm here to work.
Are you? Right. I see. Crikey!
Is my roommate a dick?
Hmm?
Listen. If we can't break the ice,
how about we drown it?
CHARLES: So what's your story?
You the poor kid that never got to
go to Exeter or Andover?
Despite my privileged upbringing,
I'm actually quite well-balanced.
I have a chip on both shoulders.
(CHUCKLES)
Maybe you're just better with the old
integers than you are with people.
My first grade teacher, she told me that
I was born with two helpings of brain
but only half a helping of heart.
(CHUCKLES)
CHARLES: Wow! She sounds lovely!
The truth is that
I don't like people much.
And they don't much like me.
But why,
with all your obvious wit and charm?
(LAUGHS)
Seriously, John.
Mathematics.
Mathematics is never going to lead you
to a higher truth.
And you know why?
Because it's boring. It's really boring.
You know, half these schoolboys
are already published?
I cannot waste time with these classes
and these books.
(COUGHS)
Memorising the weak assumptions
of lesser mortals!
(CHUCKLES)
I need to look through
to the governing dynamics.
Find a truly original idea.
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.
- It's the only way that I'll ever...
- Matter.
Yes.
MARTIN: All right, who's next?
SOL: I've played enough Go for one day.
- Come on.
- I hate this game.
Cowards, all of you!
None of you rise to meet my challenge?
Come on, Bender. Whoever wins,
Sol does his laundry all semester.
- Does that seem unfair to anyone else?
- Not at all.
- MARTIN: Look at him.
- Nash!
Taking a reverse constitutional?
I'm hoping to extract an algorithm
to define their movement.
Oh.
Psycho.
SOL: Nash, I thought you dropped out.
You ever going to go to class or...
Classes will dull your mind.
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Nash is going to stun us all
with his genius.
Which is another way of saying
he doesn't have the nerve to compete.
You scared?
Terrified. Mortified. Petrified.
Stupefied by you.
No starch.
Pressed and folded.
Let me ask you something, John.
Be my guest, Martin.
Bender and Sol here
correctly completed.
Allen's proof of Perron's conjecture.
Adequate work without innovation.
- I'm flattered. You flattered?
- Flattered.
And I've got two weapons briefs
under security review by the DoD.
Derivative drivel.
But Nash achievements, zero.
I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual question coming?
What if you never come up
with your original idea?
How will it feel when I'm chosen
for Wheeler and you're not?
What if you lose?
You should not have won.
Hmm.
I had the first move,
my play was perfect.
The hubris of the defeated.
The game is flawed.
MARTIN: Gentlemen,
the great John Nash.
CHARLES: You've been in here
for two days.
You know Hansen
has just published another paper?
I can't even find a topic
for my doctorate.
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.
This is a group playing touch football.
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over breadcrumbs.
And this here is a woman who is
chasing a man who stole her purse.
John, you watched a mugging.
That's weird.
In competitive behaviour,
someone always loses.
Well, my niece knows that, John,
and she's about this high.
See, if I could derive an equilibrium
where prevalence is a non-singular
event, where nobody loses.
Can you imagine the effect that
that would have on conflict scenarios...
When did you last eat?
- When did you last eat?
- Currency exchange?
You know, food.
You have no respect
for cognitive reverie, you know that?
Yes. But pizza...
Now, pizza I have enormous respect for.
And, of course, beer.
I have respect for beer.
I have respect for beer!
(INDISTINCT TALKING
AND LAUGHTER)
BENDER: Good evening, Neils. Ladies.
MARTIN: Hey, Nash.
Who's winning? You or you?
BENDER: Good evening, Nash.
SOL: Hey, guys. Hey, Nash.
WOMAN: He's looking at you for sure.
Me?
Nash.
Hey, Nash.
Neils is trying to get your attention.
BENDER: You're joking.
SOL: Oh, no.
- Go with God.
- Come back a man.
- Fortune favours the brave.
- Bombs away.
Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success
dramatically improve with each attempt?
This is going to be classic.
Maybe you want to buy me a drink.
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say
in order for you
to have intercourse with me,
but could we assume
that I've said all that?
Essentially, we're talking about
fluid exchange, right?
So, could we just go straight to the sex?
Oh, that was sweet.
WOMAN: Have a nice night, asshole!
NEILSON: Ladies, wait!
I especially liked the bit about
fluid exchange. It was really charming.
PROFESSOR: Walk with me, John.
I've been meaning to talk with you.
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.
Wheeler, sir.
That would be my first choice.
And, actually,
I don't really have a second choice, sir.
John, your fellows
have attended classes.
They've written papers.
They've published.
- Oh, I'm still searching, sir, for my...
- Your original idea.
Governing dynamics, sir.
It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid
it's just not nearly good enough.
- May I?
- Thank you.
I've been working
on manifold embedding.
My bargaining stratagems
are starting to show some promise.
If you could just arrange
another meeting,
if you would be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein.
- I've repeatedly asked you for that, sir.
- Now, John...
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...
John.
Do you see what they're doing in there?
Congratulations, Professor.
MAX: Thank you, sir. Thank you.
It's the pens.
Reserved for a member
of the department
that makes the achievement
of a lifetime.
Now what do you see, John?
Recognition.
Well done, Professor. Well done.
Well, try seeing accomplishment.
Is there a difference?
John, you haven't focused.
I'm sorry,
but up to this point, your record
doesn't warrant any placement at all.
Good day.
PROFESSOR:
And my compliments to you, sir.
MAX: Thank you so much.
(POIGNANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
JOHN: I can't see it.
(GROANS)
CHARLES: Jesus Christ, John.
I can't fail.
- This is all I am.
- Come on, let's go out.
I have to get something done.
- I can't keep staring into space.
- John, that's enough!
Got to face the wall, follow their rules,
read their books, do their classes.
You wanna do some damage,
that's fine, but don't mess around.
Come on! Go on, bust your head!
Kill yourself.
John, do it. Don't mess around.
Bust your head! Go on,
bust that worthless head wide open.
Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is your problem?
It's not my problem.
And it's not your problem.
It's their problem.
Your answer isn't, ""Face the wall.""
It's out there,
where you've been working.
(JOHN GASPS)
That was heavy.
That Isaac Newton fellow was right.
- He was onto something.
- Clever boy.
(GIGGLES)
JOHN: Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it in a minute.
CHARLES: (LAUGHING) Oh, God!
NEILSON: Incoming, gentlemen.
SOL: Ay-yi-yi.
Deep breaths.
SOL: Nash, you might want to stop
shuffling your papers for five seconds.
I will not buy you gentlemen beer.
BENDER:
We're not here for beer, my friend.
JOHN: Oh.
Does anyone else feel
she should be moving in slow motion?
Will she want a large wedding,
you think?
Shall we say swords, gentlemen?
Pistols at dawn?
Have you remembered nothing?
Recall the lessons of Adam Smith,
the father of modern economics.
TOGETHER: ""In competition"",
""individual ambition
serves the common good.""
- Exactly!
- Every man for himself, gentlemen.
BENDER: Those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.
MARTIN: I'm not going to strike out.
SOL: You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.
SOL: All right, nobody move.
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.
MARTIN: Oh, God. All right,
he may have the upper hand now,
but wait until he opens his mouth.
Remember the last time?
BENDER: Yes. That was
one for the history books.
Adam Smith needs revision.
What are you talking about?
If we all go for the blonde,
we block each other.
Not a single one of us
is going to get her.
So then we go for her friends,
but they will all give us
the cold shoulder
because nobody
likes to be second choice.
Well, what if
no one goes for the blonde?
We don't get in each other's way
and we don't insult the other girls.
That's the only way we win.
That's the only way we all get laid.
(CHUCKLES)
Adam Smith said,
""The best result comes""
""from everyone in the group
doing what's best for himself.""
Right? That's what he said. That's right.
Incomplete. Incomplete, okay?
Because the best result will come
from everyone in the group
doing what's best for himself
and the group.
Nash, if this is some way for you to get
the blonde on your own,
you can go to hell.
Governing dynamics, gentlemen.
Governing dynamics.
Adam Smith was wrong.
SOL: Here we go.
NEILSON: Careful, careful.
Thank you.
""C"" of ""S"" equals ""C"" of ""T.""
(INDISTINCT MUTTERING)
(MUTTERING CONTINUES)
(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
You do realise this flies in the face
of 150 years of economic theory?
Yes, I do, sir.
That's rather presumptuous,
don't you think?
It is, sir.
Well, Mr Nash, with a breakthrough
of this magnitude,
I'm confident you will get
any placement you like.
Wheeler Labs, they'll ask you to
recommend two team members.
PROFESSOR: Stills and Frank
are excellent choices.
Sol and Bender, sir.
Sol and Bender
are extraordinary mathematicians.
Has it occurred to you, Mr Nash,
that Sol and Bender
might have plans of their own?
BENDER: (LAUGHING) We made it!
Wheeler, we made it!
Cheers, cheers, cheers!
Okay, awkward moment, gentlemen.
Um...
Governing dynamics.
Congratulations, John.
BENDER: Toast! To Wheeler Labs!
SOL: To Wheeler!
MAN: General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.
Dr Nash, your coat?
Thank you, sir.
Doctor.
General, this is Wheeler team leader,
Dr John Nash.
Glad you could come, Doctor.
Hello.
Right this way.
GENERAL: We've been intercepting
radio transmissions from Moscow.
The computer can't detect a pattern,
but I'm sure it's code.
JOHN: Why is that, General?
GENERAL: Ever just know something,
Dr Nash?
Constantly.
GENERAL:
We've developed several ciphers.
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data?
Doctor?
JOHN: 6-7-3-7. 0-3-6...
8-4-9-4.
9-1-4-0-3-4.
0-3-4.
I need a map.
JOHN: 46-13-08, 67-46-90.
Starkey Corners, Maine.
48-03-01 . 91 -26-35.
Prairie Portage, Minnesota.
These are latitudes and longitudes.
There are at least 10 others.
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the US.
Extraordinary.
Gentlemen, we need to move on this.
Who's Big Brother?
You've done your country
a great service, son.
- Captain!
- Yes, sir.
Accompany Dr Nash.
What are the Russians moving,
General?
Captain Rogers will escort you
to the unrestricted area, Doctor.
Thank you.
ROGERS: Dr Nash, follow me, please.
(OVER RADIO) None of those who
have said they don't like the method
have told us any other method
they could use that would be effective.
DRIVER: It's Dr Nash.
GUARD: All right.
- Thank you, sir.
- Home run at the Pentagon?
Have they actually taken the word
""classified"" out of the dictionary?
Hi. The air conditioning broke again.
How am I supposed to be in here
saving the world if I'm melting?
Our hearts go out to you, John.
You know, two trips to the Pentagon
in four years.
- That's two more than we've had.
- It gets better, John.
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.
You know,
the Russians have the H-bomb,
the Nazis
are repatriating South America,
the Chinese have a standing army
of 2.8 million,
and I am doing stress tests on a dam.
Look, you made the cover
of Fortune again.
Please note the use of the word ""you,""
not ""we.""
That was supposed to be just me.
(CHUCKLES)
Not only do they rob me
of the Fields Medal,
now they put me on the cover
of Fortune magazine with these hacks,
these scholars of trivia.
John, exactly what is the difference
between genius and most genius?
Quite a lot.
He's your son.
Anyway, you've got 10 minutes.
JOHN: I've always got 10 minutes.
BENDER: Before your new class?
Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?
You are a doctor, John, and no.
Come on. You know the drill,
we get these beautiful facilities...
MIT gets America's great minds of today
teaching America's
great minds of tomorrow.
Poor bastards.
Now, have a nice day at school.
The bell is ringing.

The eager young minds of tomorrow.
(LOUD JACK-HAMMERING OUTSIDE)
STUDENT: Can we leave one open,
Professor? It's really hot, sir.
Your comfort comes second
to my ability to hear my own voice.
JOHN: Personally, I think this class
will be a waste of your,
and what is infinitely worse,
my time.
However, here we are.
So, you may attend or not.
You may complete your assignments
at your whim.
We have begun.
Miss.
ALICIA: Excuse me!
- Excuse me!
- FOREMAN: Hey, hey!
ALICIA: Hi!
We have a little problem.
It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed
and extremely noisy with them open.
So I was wondering
if there was any way you could,
I don't know, maybe work
someplace else for about 45 minutes?
FOREMAN: Not a problem.
ALICIA: Thank you so much!
FOREMAN: Break! WORKER: Got it!
FOREMAN: Let's go.
Clean it up a little bit.
As you will find
in multivariable calculus, there is often
a number of solutions
for any given problem.
As I was saying, this problem here
will take some of you
many months to solve.
For others among you,
it will take you
the term of your natural lives.
PARCHER: Professor Nash.
William Parcher.
Big Brother,
at your service.
What can I do
for the Department of Defense?
Are you here to give me a raise?
Let's take a walk.
- Impressive work at the Pentagon.
- Yes, it was.
Oppenheimer used to say, ""Genius
sees the answer before the question.""
You knew Oppenheimer?
His project was under my supervision.
Which project?
- That project.
- It's not that simple, you know?
Well, you ended the war.
We incinerated 150,000 people
in a heartbeat.
Great deeds come at great cost,
Mr Parcher.
Conviction, it turns out, is a luxury
of those on the sidelines, Mr Nash.
I'll try and keep that in mind.
PARCHER: So, John, no family,
no close friends.
Why is that?
JOHN: I like to think
it's because I'm a lone wolf.
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.
(CHUCKLES)
Well, there are certain endeavours
where your lack of personal connection
would be considered an advantage.
- This is a secure area.
- They know me.
PARCHER: Have you ever been here?
JOHN: We were told
during our initial briefing
that these warehouses were abandoned.
PARCHER:
That's not precisely accurate.
(INDISTINCT TALKING OVER RADIO)
(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
(RADIO TRANSMITS
RUSSIAN SPEAKER)
PARCHER: By telling you
what I'm about to tell you,
I am increasing your security clearance
to top secret.
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.
Get it?
What operation?
Those are a good idea.
This factory is in Berlin.
We seized it at the end of the war.
Nazi engineers were attempting to
build a portable atomic bomb.
The Soviets reached this facility before
we did, and we lost the damn thing.
The routing orders at the Pentagon.
They were about this, weren't they?
The Soviets aren't as unified
as people believe.
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svoboda,
the ""New Freedom,""
has control of the bomb
and intends to detonate it on U.S. soil.
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.
PARCHER: Man is capable of as much
atrocity as he has imagination.
New Freedom has sleeper agents
here in the U.S.
McCarthy is an idiot, but, unfortunately,
that doesn't make him wrong.
New Freedom communicates
to its agents
through codes imbedded in newspapers
and magazines,
and that's where you come in.
You see, John, what distinguishes you
is that you are, quite simply,
the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.
What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?
Commit this list of periodicals
to memory.
PARCHER: Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes, decipher them.
DOCTOR:
Place your chin on the chin rest.
- Stare into the light.
- TECHNICIAN: Pulse 88, regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, this may be
a little uncomfortable.
(GROANS)
PARCHER: It's got a little zap to it,
doesn't it?
He just implanted a radium diode.
Don't worry, it's safe.
The isotope decays predictably.
As a result,
these numbers change over time.
They're the access codes
to your drop spot.
So what am I now, a spy?
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
JOHN: Come.
Boy, you must be really important.
It's all right, Mike.
What are you working on?
Classified.
- Everyone waited half an hour.
- JOHN: For?
Class.
You missed class today.
Well, I suspect that
nobody missed me.
The problem that you left on the board...
I solved it.
No, you didn't.
You didn't even look.
I never said that the vector fields
were rational functions.
Your solution is elegant.
Though on this particular occasion
ultimately incorrect.
You're still here.
I'm still here.
Why?
I'm wondering, Professor Nash,
if I can ask you to dinner.
You do eat, don't you?
On occasion, yeah.
Table for one.
Prometheus alone, chained to the rock
with the bird circling overhead,
you know how it is.
(CHUCKLES)
No, I expect that you wouldn't know.
Leave your address with my office.
I'll pick you up Friday at 8:00
and we'll eat.
One more thing. Do you have a name,
or should I just keep calling you ""miss""?
Governor, may I present...
- Miss Alicia Larde.
- Miss Alicia Larde.
Professor, please.
You and the governor.
Wait, one second. I'm sorry.
I want a copy of this.
First big date and all, you know.
So, you boys need to look good,
which is not a state you find yourselves
in altogether naturally.
There. Better.
I'm surprising him.
You just keep on surprising him.
Professor.
(AMBIENT PARTY NOISES)
God must be a painter.
Why else would we have
so many colours?
So you're a painter?
That's not actually what I said,
but, yes, I am.
Here.
Me. Your date.
Practise human interaction
and social comportment.
That's a plan.
Champagne would be lovely.
I'll be outside.
I will get the champagne.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for that.
No, keep it.
I believe in deciding
things will be good luck.
- Do you?
- No.
I don't believe in luck.
But I do believe
in assigning value to things.
Oh.
I once tried to count them all.
I actually made it to 4,348.
You are exceptionally odd.
I bet you're very popular with the girls.
A pair of odd ducks, then.
Mmm.
Pick a shape.
What?
Pick a shape, an animal, anything.
Okay.

Do it again.

- All right. What would you like?
- Do an octopus.

(DOG BARKS)
(ALICIA CHUCKLES)
You don't talk much, do you?
I can't talk to you about my work, Alicia.
I don't mean work.
I find that polishing my interactions
in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.
I have a tendency
to expedite information flow
by being direct.
I often don't get a pleasant result.
Try me.
All right.
I find you attractive.
Your aggressive moves towards me
indicate that you feel the same way.
But still, ritual requires that we continue
with a number of platonic activities
before we have sex.
I am proceeding with those activities,
but in point of actual fact,
all I really want to do is have intercourse
with you as soon as possible.
Are you going to slap me now?
How was that result?
What are you doing?
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned reoccurrences
within periodicals over time. And you?
You talk funny, Mr Nash.
Do I know you?
My uncle says you're very smart
but not very nice,
so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.
And who might your uncle be?
The prodigal roommate
returns.
(CHUCKLES)
- Come here!
- Charles, Charles.
My sister got herself killed
in a car crash.
Not too far now, Marcee!
Her cowboy husband was too drunk
to know that he was too drunk to drive.
So, I took her in.
She's so small.
Well, she's young, John.
That's how they come.
I'm at Harvard
doing the great author's workshop.
D.H. bloody Lawrence.
I really do think
you should buy yourself a new book.
(CHUCKLES)
Well, I've been reading a lot about you.
How are you, John?
At first, all my work here was trivial,
but a new assignment came up and...
I can't really tell you any details.
Top secret? Black bag? Black ops?
Something like that.
- And...
- Yes?
Well, I met a girl.
- No! A human girl?
- Homo sapien.
- A biped?
- Yep. And contrary to all probabilities,
she finds me attractive
on a number of different levels.
God, that's wonderful.
Well, there's no accounting for taste,
is there?
- Should I marry her?
- Oh, God. Right.
I mean, everything's going well.
The job is fine. I have enough money.
It all seems to add up.
But how do you know for sure?
Nothing's ever for sure, John.
That's the only sure thing I do know.
Good evening.
Alicia, please don't be angry.
I just lost track of time at work,
- again.
- Mmm-hmm.
I'm sorry.
I didn't have time to wrap it.
Happy birthday.
The refractive faces of the glass,
you see,
they create a full wavelength dispersal,
- so if you look inside it, you can see...
- Every possible colour.
Every possible colour. Yeah.
Remember you said that time,
""God must be a painter
""because of all the colours""?
At the governor's house, you said that.
I didn't think you were listening.
I was listening.
It's beautiful.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Alicia, does our relationship
warrant long-term commitment?
Because I need some kind of proof,
some kind of verifiable, empirical data.

I'm sorry, just give me a moment
to redefine my girlish notions
of romance.
A proof?
Verifiable data.
Okay.
Well, how big is the universe?
Infinite.
How do you know?
I know because all the data
indicates it's infinite.
- But it hasn't been proven yet?
- No.
- You haven't seen it.
- No.
How do you know for sure?
I don't, I just believe it.
It's the same with love, I guess.
Now, the part that you don't know
is if I want to marry you.

This is not what I signed up for.
Every time a car backfires
or a door slams...
I understand better
than you could possibly imagine.
You need to calm down, John.
Now listen to me.
We're closing in on the bomb,
in large part due to your work.
Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?
William, my circumstance has changed.
Alicia's pregnant.
I told you attachments were dangerous.
You chose to marry the girl.
I did nothing to prevent it.
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety
is for you to continue your work.
Well, I'll just quit.
You won't.
Why would I not?
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.
You quit working for me,
I quit working for you.
Parcher! Parcher!
John, you all right?
John?
Turn it off! Turn off the light!
Why would you do that?
Why would you turn the light on?
What is wrong with you?
You have to go to your sister's.
I left the car at the back.
Now you can take Commonwealth,
no side streets.
- John...
- Stay where it's crowded.
John, I'm not going anywhere!
When you get to your sister's,
you wait for me to call.
No, I'm not going.
- Just get your things.
- I'm not leaving!
Stop! Stop it.
Please, Alicia.
I'll explain when I can.

What's wrong?
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.
Well, now you tell me, what is it?
Professor Nash!
Welcome!
After?
So, we see that the zeroes

Singularities in space-time then...
And conventional number theory...

Just for a chat.
It appears I have no choice.

Tell me who you see.
How do you say
""Charles Herman"" in Russian?
How do you say it in Russian?
There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.
He's right there. He's right there.
Stop! I don't know anything!
Stop! I don't know anything!
My name is John Nash.
I'm being held against my will.
Somebody call
the Department of Defence.
My name is John Nash.
I'm being held against my will!
ALICIA: What's wrong with him?
John has schizophrenia.
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.
But... But his work.
He deals with conspiracy. So...
Yes. Yes, I know.
In John's world, these behaviours
are accepted, encouraged.
As such,
his illness may have gone untreated
far longer than is typical.
What do you mean? How long?
Possibly since graduate school.
At least that's when his hallucinations
seem to have begun.
What are you talking about?
What hallucinations?
One, so far, that I am aware of.
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.
Charles isn't imaginary.
He and John have been best friends
since Princeton.
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?
He's always in town
for so little time, lecturing.
- Was he at your wedding?
- He had to teach.
Have you seen a picture of him,
or talked to him on the telephone?
This is ridiculous.
I phoned Princeton.
According to their housing records,
John lived alone.
Now, which is more likely?
That your husband,
a mathematician
with no military training,
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians...
You're making him sound crazy.
Or, that he has lost his grip on reality?
Now, the only way I can help him
is to show him the difference
between what is real
and what is in his mind.
Come on.
What's he been working on?
His work is classified.
He mentioned a supervisor
by the name of William Parcher.
Maybe Mr Parcher
can clarify things for us.
But I can't get to him
without clearances.
You want me to help you get the details
of my husband's work?
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.
Is that what you think?
- What did the doctor say?
- Is he sick?
I don't know. I want to see
what John's been working on.
Alicia, you know,
you can't go in his office.
You know, it's classified, Alicia. Stop.
(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say something?
Alicia, I mean,
John has always been a little weird.
He said he was doing code-breaking.
That it was eyes-only.
- Top-secret, part of the military effort.
- Was he?
Well, it was possible, you know?
I mean,
directives come down all the time
that some of us aren't cleared for.
- It was possible.
- Possible, but not likely.
Lately, he'd become so much more
agitated, and then when you called...
So, is this all he's been doing
every day?
Cutting up magazines?
Well, not all.
(DOOR OPENS)
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
- I missed you.
- I missed you.
I have to talk to you.
Okay.
Alicia, I've been thinking about it,
and I do realise that my behaviour
and my inability
to discuss the situation with you
must have appeared insane.
I left you with no other choice.
I do understand, and I'm truly sorry.
That's okay.
Everything is gonna be all right.
Everything is gonna be all right.
(WHISPERS)
We just have to talk quietly.
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.
I'm gonna tell you everything now.
It's breaking with protocol,
but you need to know
because you have to help me
get out of here.
Alicia, I've been doing top-secret work
for the government.
There's a threat that exists
of catastrophic proportions.
I think the Russians
feel my profile is too high.
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.
They're keeping me here
to try to stop me from doing my work.
- You have to get to Wheeler.
- Stop.
- You have to find William Parcher.
- Stop.
- He could help us. He could help us.
- Stop. Stop.
- He could help us...
- Stop!
I went to Wheeler.
Good, good.
There is no William Parcher.
Of course there is.
I've been working for him.
Doing what? Breaking codes?
Dropping packages in a secret mailbox
for the government to pick up?
How could you know that?
Sol followed you.
- He thought it was harmless.
- Sol followed me?
They've never been opened.
It isn't real.
There is no conspiracy, John.
There is no William Parcher.
It's in your mind.
Do you understand, baby?
You're sick.
You're sick, John.
John?
John?

(DOOR OPENS)
John?
John?
The implant is gone.
I can't find it.
It's gone.
ROSEN: You see,
the nightmare of schizophrenia
is not knowing what's true.
Imagine if you had suddenly learned that
the people and the places
and the moments most important to you
were not gone, not dead,
but worse, had never been.
What kind of hell would that be?
NURSE 1: Administering insulin.
NURSE 2: 8:42 a.m.
(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
How often?
Five times a week for 10 weeks.
ALICIA: John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.
And Hansen
is running the department now.
So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.
Yeah.
John won't come near the campus,
though. I think he's ashamed.
(BABY CRIES)
Hey, hey.
Want this?
So, Alicia, how are you holding up?
Well, delusions have passed.
They're saying with the medication
and low stress environment...
No...
I mean, how are you?
I think often what I feel
is obligation.
Or guilt over wanting to leave.
Rage against John, against God, and...
But...
Then I look at him,
and I force myself to see
the man that I married.
And he becomes that man.
He's transformed
into someone that I love.
And I'm transformed into
someone who loves him.
It's not all the time,
but it's enough.
I think John is a very lucky man, Alicia.
So unlucky.
ALICIA: This is us.
SOL: This is it?
- It's nice.
- ALICIA: It's near where I work.
John? You have a visitor.
Hi.
Hi.
I hope it's okay.
Hey, chief.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.
I quit, actually.
- Hello.
- Hey, John.
Have you met Harvey?
(SOL STAMMERS IN EMBARRASSMENT)
- John, there's no...
- Relax, it's okay.
There's no point in being nuts
if you can't have a little fun.
Jesus Christ, John.
You know, I should have known.
Here you go.
I can take those later.
You're supposed to take them now.
Can I bring you something?
I'm okay.
Okay.
So, yeah,
I was in town giving a workshop.
I go back tonight.
You know, Bender,
he really wanted to stop by
and, you know, see you.
You know, say hi.
Squeamish?
Yeah.
I suppose I would be, too.
But, alas, I'm stuck with me.
I'm trying to solve
the Riemann hypothesis.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah?
I figured if I dazzle them,
they will have to reinstate me.
But it's difficult with the medication
because it's hard to
see the solution.
(POIGNANT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
You know, John, you should go easy.
There are other things besides work.
What are they?
(BABY CRIES)
(ALICIA COOS MATERNALLY)
(DOOR CLOSES)
What are you thinking about?
What do people do?
It's life, John.
Activities available.
Just add meaning.
You could try leaving the house.
You know, maybe talk to people.
You could try taking out the garbage.
(INDISTINCT VOICE)
JOHN: (MUFFLED) And there's
some more... There's some more in...
Who... Who were you talking to?
Garbage man.
Garbage men don't come at night.
I guess around here they do.

I don't think
that I would go that way, John.
It's time for you to get back to work.

What? What?
- Dr Rosen said...
- Rosen! That quack!
""Schizophrenic break from reality,""
right?
Psychological bullshit!
Look at me, John.
John, look at me.
Do I look like I'm imagined?
Wheeler has no record of you.
Do you think we list our personnel?
John, I'm sorry
you had to go through all this.
I've gone to a great deal of trouble
to get you back.
I can restore your status at Wheeler.
I can let the world know what you did.
But I need you now, soldier.
I was so scared you weren't real.

No!

Charles was watching him.
He was okay.
There is no one here.
Oh, my God!
- Charles was watching him.
- There is no one here!
He's been injected
with a cloaking serum.
I can see him because of a chemical
that was released into my bloodstream
when my implant dissolved.
I couldn't tell you,
it was for your own protection!
Alicia!
No!
Hello, I need Dr Rosen's office, please.
You've got to stop her, John.
You leave her out of it.
Who are you talking to?
- It's not her fault.
- John.
- She'll compromise us again.
- No, she won't.
You'll go back to the hospital.
John, answer me!
Countless people will die.
Alicia, please put the phone down.
I can't let that happen.
Yes, hello?
Hi, I need Dr Rosen. Is he in?
I'm sorry, John.
No!

(TYRES SCREECH)
No!
She never gets old.
Marcee can't be real.
She never gets old.
You see them now?
Yes.
Why did you stop your meds?
Because I couldn't do my work.
I couldn't help with the baby.
I couldn't...
I couldn't respond to my wife.
You think that's better than being crazy?
We'll need to start you on a higher run
of insulin shocks and a new medication.
No.
There has to be another way.
Schizophrenia is degenerative.
Some days may be symptom-free,
but over time, you are getting worse.
It's a problem. That's all it is.
It's a problem with no solution.
And that's what I do, I solve problems.
- That's what I do best.
- This isn't math.
You can't come up with a formula
to change the way
you experience the world.
All I have to do is apply my mind.
There's no theorem, no proof.
- You can't reason your way out of this.
- Why not? Why can't I?
Because your mind is where
the problem is in the first place.
I can do this.
I can work it out. All I need is time.
Is that the baby?
The baby is at my mother's, John.
(MARCEE HUMS)
Without treatment, John,
the fantasies may take over entirely.
ALICIA: You almost ready?
Rosen's waiting outside.
I can't go back to that hospital.
I won't come home.
He said that if you said that,
he has commitment papers
for me to sign.
Well, maybe you won't sign them.
Maybe you'll just give me some time.
I will try to figure this out.
Whatever you do,
Rosen is right about one thing.
You shouldn't be here.
I'm not safe any more.
Would you have hurt me, John?
I don't know.
Maybe you should let Dr Rosen
drive you to your mother's.
ALICIA: He told me to leave.
ALICIA: I understand.

to write, and I tried you at MacArthur's,
but you'd left, and I just...
This is Helinger's old office.
Yeah.
Yeah, I stole it from him.
Seems that you won after all, Martin.
They were wrong, John. No one wins.
Please, please, have a seat.
God, it's so good to see you.
What brings you back to Princeton?
John? John, I'm sorry,
but you have to tell him.
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!
Tell him your work is critical.
John, please!
Is there any chance
that you could ignore what I just did?
Of course. What are old friends for?
Is that what we are, Martin? Friends?
John, of course.
Of course. We always have been.
Alicia and I think that fitting in,
being part of a community,
might do me some good.
That a certain level of attachment,
familiar places, familiar people,
might help me elbow out
these certain delusions that I have.
It's a lot to ask, and now that I'm here,
I'm quite certain
that you will just say no.
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.
(SIGHS)
Huh.
Will you be needing an office?
No.
No, I could just work out of the library.
Well, this guy tries to
wander into the library,
but he doesn't have ID.
Why can't people read their memos?
Then, he goes totally nuts.
You're not real! You're not real.
There's no mission.
Oh, shit. Shit.
You're not real! You are not real!
Is this what you are, soldier?
Some useless ghoul?
The local madman?
- I'm not a soldier.
- You're gonna end up in a cell!
Old, worthless, discarded.
There's no mission.
And while you rock and drool,
the world will burn to ashes!
You are not real! You are not real!
You're still talking to me, soldier.
There's no mission! I'm not a soldier!
John! John!
Hey, hey, hey. John, John. It's okay.
I just heard what happened,
I'm sorry. John.
- I'm not a soldier.
- John. Hey, Nash.
Nash, hey, you're all right.
Nash.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!
John?
You should've seen their faces.
Everybody was just staring at me.
John, you know that
stress triggers the delusions.
I know.
But then, on the way home,
Charles was there.
Sometimes, I really miss talking to him.
Maybe Rosen's right.
Maybe I have to think about going back
into the hospital again.
No. Come here.
Maybe try again tomorrow.
John, now you can't ignore me forever.
Charles, you've been
a very good friend to me. The best.
But I won't talk to you again.
I just can't.
Same goes for you, baby girl.
(SNIFFLES)
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
I was wondering
if I might audit your course.
It's an honour, Professor Nash.
Is something wrong?
This will be my first class.
Good morning, eager young minds.
(JOHN MUTTERS)
It's never going to work, John.
You're just humiliating yourself.
It's pathetic! You are being pathetic.
I'm ashamed of you!

Oh, man!
Are you coming?
You're going to be late.
- Dad, you've got my book.
- What?
- You've got my book.
- Oh, right.
Thanks.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
See you tonight.
ALICIA: Bye, honey.
(POIGNANT MUSIC)
Did you just solve Riemann?
Well, what do you think?
That's an analogue to Frobenius
for non-commutative extensions.
Yes, it is.
But it only appears to work sporadically,
so, no.
But I believe I'm making progress.
You're John Nash, right?
- Toby Kelly.
- Hello.
I've been studying your equilibrium,
the one you wrote here at Princeton.
To come up with something
totally original, the way you did.
You know, I was young.
I've been developing a theory.
I believe I can prove that Galois
extensions are covering spaces.
That everything,
everything is connected.
That it's all part of the same subject.
When was the last time you ate?
- Excuse me?
- You know, food.
Oh, uh...
My wife, she loves mayonnaise.
Thank you.
Go on.
The function is in the two categories.
MARTIN: Alicia!
Alicia!
JOHN: And meet together
at a maximum speed of,
let us say, 10 miles per hour.
So you have a fly
on the tyre of bicycle ""B,""
and the fly,
who can travel at 20 miles an hour,
leaves the tyre of bicycle ""B""
and flies to the tyre of bicycle ""A,""
and backwards and forwards, and so on
and so forth, until the two bikes collide
and the poor little fly is squashed.
This is the important thing about
actually focusing in and comprehending
the area that you're dealing with.
Mathematics is very specific,
and it is an art form, no matter what
these people around here will tell you,
especially the people from Biology.
Don't listen to any of those people.
Let me go back to
what you were doing before
because I think I might want to steal this
and write a book and get famous.
I was thinking that I might teach.
A classroom with 50 students
can be daunting for anyone.
John, besides, you're a terrible teacher.
I'm an acquired taste, Martin.
I was hoping there still might be
something I could contribute.
What about the...
Well, you know. Are they gone?
No, they're not gone.
And maybe they never will be.
But I've gotten used to ignoring them,
and I think, as a result,
they've given up on me.
You think that's what it's like with all
our dreams and our nightmares, Martin?
You've got to keep feeding them
for them to stay alive?
John, they haunt you, though.
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody is haunted by their past.
Well, good-bye.
John, I'll talk to the department.
Maybe in the spring.
Hey, Nash.
You scared?
Terrified. Mortified. Petrified.
Stupefied by you.
Now you ought best ring Alicia,
or you're gonna get me...
- I'll ring her.
- In an awful lot of trouble.
- Thanks, Professor.
- Good-bye.
- Have a nice day.
- Good-bye.
- Papers in hand, Mr Beyer.
- Monday, sir.
Professor Nash?
Can you see him?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Positive? He's within your vision? Good.
- (LAUGHING)
Forgive me, I'm just always suspicious
of new people.
- See you next week, Professor.
- See you next week.
So now that I know that you're real,
who are you, and what can I do for you?
Professor, my name is Thomas King.
- Thomas King?
- Mmm-hmm.
And I'm here to tell you that you're being
considered for the Nobel Prize.
Forgive me, but I'm just a little stunned.
Over the past few years,
your equilibrium has become
a cornerstone of modern economics.
JOHN: Suddenly,
everybody likes that one.
What about my work on other some
such projects, like manifold embedding?
The application
of your bargaining problem
to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...
- Antitrust cases?
- Yes.
I never would have considered that.
Have I just reached some level
of honesty that borders on stupidity?
(LAUGHS) No, you haven't.
Because I wouldn't have thought of that.
Shall we have tea?
I don't go in there. I usually
just take my sandwich in the library.
Come on, John. Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.
Most commercially available
brands of tea
are not suitable to my palate, you see.
I'm not...
There are some Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough.
I enjoy the flavour that they have.
I have not been in this room
for quite some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.
JOHN: Why, thank you, young lady.
Things have certainly changed
around here. I have a son that age.
Harvard.
(SNIFFS)
I would have thought the nominations for
the Nobel Prize would've been secret.
I would have thought you'd only find out
if you won or lost.
That is generally the case, yes,
but these are special circumstances.
The awards are substantial.
They require private funding. As such,
the image of the Nobel is...
I see. So, you came here
to find out if I was crazy?
Find out if I would screw everything up
if I actually won?
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and squawk like a chicken,
things of this nature?
Something like that, yes.
Would I embarrass you?
Yes, it is possible.
You see, I am crazy.
I take the newer medications,
but I still see things that are not here.
I just choose not to acknowledge them.
Like a diet of the mind, I choose
not to indulge certain appetites.
Like my appetite for patterns.
Perhaps my appetite to imagine
and to dream.
MAN: Professor Nash.
It's good to have you here, John.
Thank you.
It's an honour, sir.
Thank you very much.
A privilege, Professor.
Professor.
- Nicely done, John.
- Thank you, Tom.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ed.
That was certainly most unexpected.
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you.
I've always believed in numbers,
in the equations and logics
that lead to reason.
But after a lifetime of such pursuits,
I ask, what truly is logic?
Who decides reason?
My quest has taken me through
the physical, the metaphysical,
the delusional and back.
And I have made the most important
discovery of my career.
The most important discovery of my life.
It is only in the mysterious
equations of love
that any logical reasons can be found.
I'm only here tonight because of you.
You are the reason I am.
You are all my reasons.
Thank you.
JOHN: So nice to have met you.
I'll call for the car, Dad.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
- Are you ready to go now?
- Yes, I am.
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
What is it? What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
- Come with me, young lady.
- Oh.

We will have your favorite
cake and this time
you can even wear
the purple hat.
But it's my last show tonight
and I need to leave by 5.
So get here in time, OK?
Funny how birthdays make
me think of you, David.
Then, again, everything does.
So here is another truth, the
truth is I miss us, David.
The truth is I was wrong.
Maybe I don't know what
the truth is anymore.
Maybe the truth just is.
Hey, honey, it's me.
Happy Birthday.
So I'm here at the
theater, you're not.
Multiple choice, what's
wrong with this picture?
Oh, my god, you guys actually
wear floss as a costume.
I wish my brain
could unknow this.
All right.
Well, call me back.
OK?
Five
minutes to showtime.
Five minutes to showtime.
Romy?
OK, I'm using my key.
Romy, I'm coming in.
I am traveling
through the house.
I know I'm late, but
I can't be that late.
Romy?
Oh!
God damn it.
Son of a... Hey, babe,
explain to me why at 36
I finally have my head
together but my body
is totally falling apart.
Locked.
OK, well, this is
a little disturbing.
You're writing snail
mail instead of texting.
You have house plants that
are alive and can't be smoked.
I hope you still have
visiting pigeons.
Come on, what's going on?
Romy!
Romy!
David?
Yes
If it all goes to
shit in the end anyway,
what makes this all worth it?
Honey, what happened?
Hello?
Let me call Aaron.
OK?
Sure, call everyone.
Hey, this is Aaron.
OK.
I'll be there in
fifteen minutes.
I can't believe this
guy made it so far.
When I repped him he
would have meltdowns
over the weirdest things.
Like he would call
me at midnight
sobbing because
he needed his meds
but refused to go
to the drugstore.
Why might he even do that?
He was upset because
sick people had
to walk to the back of the
store but healthy people
could buy cigarettes up front.
Can you believe how
long ago that was?
When did we all meet?
2006.
Amazing.
What do we call
that decade anyway?
The aughts?
Zeros?
Seriously, that says
it all, doesn't it?
Thank you so much for coming.
It's not fair.
She take drug like
breath mint and she still
pure as driven slush.
Snow.
Slush would be for fur.
I'm sorry it's been so long
since we've seen each other.
I missed you.
How's Robert?
He's great.
So when is fashion week?
Maybe we should all
go somewhere instead.
God, that Paris flight
kills me every single time.
I would like to
punch you in teeth.
Oh, what?
Is this one on your
Transylvanian pearls of wisdom
where jet lag is
just in your mind
and if you lick a
clove of garlic...
Aaron, Hello?
Is that your brother?
Maybe we can get him to come.
How is he?
What's wrong.
Wait a minute, what?
Is there drama?
Excellent.
What is the crisis?
I want to know.
If you die who
is going to remember me
when I was young and beautiful?
When did you first
realize you were getting old?
Oh, that's easy.
When I heard my favorite song,
the one that changed my life.
It meant so much to me that
I listened to it for years,
and years, and years.
And they were playing it as
easy listening in an elevator.
Or the supermarket.
That's the worst.
Teens sprayed on a
fricking pamphlet.
Yep.
Yep, that's when you know
you're officially getting old.
And the hope that things are
going to change just kind of
dies.
It's the worst when
you take away hope.
Romy, who are you talking to?
I try to deal
with one day at a time.
It's just that lately several
days attack me at once.
Hey, did she say
what she wants?
No, she's just
talking to herself.
And she was just talking
about like Nirvana
being played in a
department store
and dropping her keys and shit.
She's talking crazy.
Hey, hi, I'm here.
What did I miss?
Aaron, I sent you an email
confirming my attendance
and asking you what we needed
but you didn't respond.
So I can go back out and get
more stuff if we need it.
She has a gun.
Holy shit.
Way to bury the lead, David.
Think we should call 911?
Let's talk to her first
and see what she needs.
Mm, here we go.
It's the Romy show.
I know you both care so
stop pretending you don't.
Am I invisible here?
What's going on?
Wait, is this for real?
What's happening?
Hey, honey,
everybody came.
Aaron's here, and Jessica,
and Ella, and Jaki, and we all
love you.
Why don't you come
out so we can talk.
Why don't I stay
in here and we talk.
Can't we just try and be
honest for a few hours?
Honest about what?
You?
Us?
Both.
Well, I for one have
questions for all of you.
Don't you ever want
to make that tape loop
in your head stop?
I mean I can fake it
with the best of them.
Go out there, pretend
that I get it,
smile so much that
my cheeks hurt.
I don't want to go home.
Shove needles in my eyeballs.
You must have felt
that too, right?
At some point.
You know where you're
driving down Mall Hall
and you just have
this sudden urge
to keep going right
off the ridge.
Just so you can
feel something else.
Or not feel anything at all.
I just need you guys
to help me figure this out.
OK?
OK?
And I promise I'm not
going to do anything crazy.
Oh, my god.
Romy, sweetie!
Sweetie, are you OK?
Oops.
Romy, think
about... think about a time
when things were good.
...Kiss the ground that you walk
on.
You finally kiss me.
We're going to be late.
They're waiting
for us aren't they?
How long do we have?
Hm?
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
So you're expecting some
sort of extended foreplay.
Is that what you're saying?
You need to stop.
I need to stop?
OK.
I'll stop.
That's totally fine, yeah.
There's... try to
find something in the kitchen
to open the door with.
Oh, my god.
There's a
window in the bathroom.
Try to find some way in.
Talk to her.
Talk to her.
Go say something.
What is wrong with you?
Romy, hey, it's Jessica.
Listen, if you come
out we can reminisce
about the good old day.
Huh?
Thanks for coming.
Glad to be here.
All right so...
hey, mama, how are you?
Do you want gloves
or do you want...
You're in my way.
So I wanna
keep glass and I wanna
keep the plastic separate.
OK.
So once this day grab
from there to there.
Here.
Where is he?
Combine these.
Oh, yes.
Good job.
There's no trash over there.
Come back.
So what happened
with the lawyer?
Really?
Love is in the air.
Ooh, Loves in the air.
Yeah.
I'm crazy like a monkey.
Ee, Oh.
Happy like a new year.
Yeah, Yeah, woo hoo.
I'm crazy like a monkey.
Ee, Oh.
Happy like a new year.
Yeah, yeah, woo hoo.
Please come out.
We can't get to the
window from the outside.
Well, try to tell Aaron that.
I don't know what else to do.
Listen, we're going to
get her out of there.
OK?
She's going to be OK.
It's not just that.
It's... what happened
to all of us?
Romy, why
are you in there?
Beautiful Objects.
Ooh.
Sold their soul to
portray a perfection.
A beautiful object.
True.
I hang them from the
walls and ceiling.
Welcome
to technical support.
If you accept press
pound and your call
will be answered by
our team in India.
Thank you.
Now listen very carefully
because the menu has changed.
If you got here because
you're schizophrenic just
listen to the little voices
in your head to tell you
what number to press.
If you a co-dependant ask
somebody to press one for you.
If you're compulsive
just press two over,
and over, and over, and over,
and over, and over, and over,
and over.
If you're paranoid stay right
there while we trace the call.
And if you're bipolar
just do whatever
you want because who
cares about you anyway?
Hey, honey, it's me.
You know how grateful I am that
you are always there for me
right?
Have you ever cried
so much that you have
tears rolling in your ears?
Champagne.
There we go.
Start talking.
Marcus... good booking,
non-committal, no condom,
never called me again.
And then Lance... made a
fortune inheriting money.
And um, he told me he's
looking for somebody younger
and hotter.
Jerry gave me herpes.
Ted cheated on me
with his sister.
I'm like, are you kidding?
Peter, Seth, Barry, Josh,
John, Tom, Thomas... and that's
in a year.
Sounds like a lot of
miscellaneous dicks.
That's a character
description not an appendage.
Thank you, Romy.
I always wanted what
you and Aaron had.
You hate me, don't you?
Huh?
I don't know, I guess
I just always hoped
that somebody is going to come
along and make everything OK.
Nobody is going to
make everything OK.
You gotta do that for
yourself, you freak.
I know that.
And I don't really know it.
You know?
No.
Yeah.
Whatever.
I don't know.
Come here, you.
It's going to be OK.
It's going to be OK.
When was the last time
you washed your hair?
11 days ago.
It smells.
I know.
Thank you for coming.
Of course.
I love you.
I love you too.
Oh, how the fuck would
she know how grateful
you are when every
single time you
meet some random dude
you forget you even
have friends until
that implodes.
And then you come
running back to us
to help put the pieces together.
Fuck you.
Fuck off.
You fuck off.
What is your problem with me?
How much time do you have?
Were you born a dickhead?
You know what,
don't answer that.
That was a rhetorical question
for someone with a brain.
Do you think anybody
is intelligent
who fakes rapt attention,
any bullshit that spouts out
of your stupid mouth.
Go plop on a shore
and start evolving.
Shut up, both of you.
Stop your bickering.
I don't see what
the point is now.
Stop.
Whatever you're doing out there.
Just stop.
OK?
All right, fuck this.
I'm calling an ambulance.
Romy?
Romy, where are your meds?
Please stop.
Yeah, how... unbelievable,
they put me on hold.
Romy...
Please stop.
Whatever you're doing out there.
Just please stop.
OK.
OK, we'll stop.
Aaron, the
number is 1-800-suicide.
When you don't want to
live and you can't die.
That's the dark side.
I just
need to be in here
and I just need you guys
to be out there with me.
Hey, Rom, babes?
I don't
want to be alone.
Just until it's light again.
OK?
Yeah, we'll stay.
OK?
We'll stay as long as you need.
Why do I love dance?
Because, to me,
life is movement.
In real life you know
your eyes are glued
to the ground in front of you.
But when you dance,
you have to look up.
You can't think anymore.
Your body takes
over, transforms you.
And it only exists
for the second
that it's inside
your body and then it
lives forever in your memory.
Lets us know that we're
all a part of eternity.
I guess I just don't really
like reality that much.
I mean I don't know who
in their right mind does.
You know so when
I'm dancing I can
pretend that it doesn't exist.
And every time that I think that
I've closed the door on reality
it comes in through the window.
Didn't you ever wish
for something more?
Are you having panic fitella?
No, I'm so freaking dizzy.
What is this?
You know I think it's nice this
tradition you having birthday
just the two of you.
Yeah, I know.
Can you believe we've done this
every year for the last eight
years?
Let me get this straight.
So you just add or
take one tiny letter
and it changes everything?
Yeah, like hepatitis
becomes hipatitis, which
describes terminal coolness.
Yes.
Forploy is when someone
misrepresents themselves
in order to get laid.
The scarecrow.
Um, Sarchasm is a gulf between
an author's sarcastic wit
and the person that
doesn't quite get it.
I don't get it.
I know, but you will.
With your help.
With my help.
So the real reason we're here.
Tavalodet moba...
Tavalodet mobarak.
Tavalodet
Tavalodet.
Mobarak.
Tavalodet mobarak.
One year before year
2010th birthday.
You know Rage folded?
Mm hm.
And the world is missing yet
another angry underground
magazine where the editor
is passionately decrying
the injustices of our society.
I think the world
is missing it.
Well, I don't.
What's up with you, Ella?
I don't know.
I think it's the stress.
I'm just totally nauseous.
Just a sec.
It's bad reason but it's
nice to be all together again.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
How are things with Dad?
You know how's working with him?
He's fine.
It's fine.
It's called growing up.
Used to call that giving up.
I don't care.
Hey, if you're happy
I'm all for it.
I'm just surprised.
Is Terrence dead yet?
Well, he probably isn't
given that with the money
you've shuffled in based
on your warped genetics
he could afford the
best shit while you guys
were exploring your dark side.
Terrence died nine months ago.
Before I went to rehab.
I've been trying to tell you.
I finally did it.
I did it.
I guess for his big.
So we had the memorial.
It was time.
OK.
OK.
Hey, Romy, can we
talk about Steve?
Yes, I'd like to
know what happened.
I wanted him to love me.
I needed him to love me.
I would have done
anything for that.
Did you love him?
No, but that wasn't the point.
Welcome to the
inauguration of the Parker
Street bitch club.
Hi, Jessica, how was Washington?
Steve, this is Ella.
Ella, Steve.
He just shot our
""issues"" issue cover.
Hm.
You know what I realized
when you were gone?
I was so miserable it was
almost like you were still here.
Isn't that weird?
And there are more
reasons to bitch.
In the 2007 homeless count
there are more than 70,000
homeless people in LA County.
10,000 of which are children
under the age of 18.
The rents downtown
are exploding.
More and more people
need affordable housing.
And they're added on to people
who are escaping violent homes
and to the mentally ill,
who are being dumped.
I mean these people
they're desperate.
Yes, I'm still
living with Romy.
It's very nice.
She no kick out
after losing home.
Of course not.
You can stay with me as
long as you like, gorgeous.
OK.
So tomorrow we're going
to march on city hall
during their meeting to prove
even more unaffordable condos
in development.
I have leaflets in my car.
Get some before you leave.
This concludes my bitch, Thank
you very much for listening.
And to go along
with your bitch...
I guess that would be me.
Was that you?
Yeah.
I made T-shirts.
You know in support
of all of our efforts
and all of your efforts.
Extra large.
And that one's
definitely yours.
How big do you think I am?
And you...
Thank you.
The newcomer.
I like your variety and color.
And that one is
of course yours.
Oh, how fitting,
your inner bitch
is finally having
her coming out party.
Hm, at least one of us
is having one of those.
Oh my god!
OK, so who's turn
is it to bitch next?
Jessica.
Yeah.
I have a feeling it will
be mostly about you.
Hm, why does she
dislike me so much?
Oh, baby, she doesn't
dislike you, she hates you.
How's your mom?
Still dominating the
charts there is Belarus?
Belgrade.
Belgrade.
See you haven't lost your voice.
No, just found mind.
I don't know what
to do anymore.
I love you.
Is this a communication
problem we're having?
Because I'll learn
your fucking language.
Yeah.
It's Russian.
I don't care how many
languages you speak.
You're an asshole in every one.
OK, two most romantic words.
Killing Steve.
Smoking section.
Marry me.
OK, my turn.
7 most disturbing words... you
have no messages at this time.
Wow.
It's per diem.
I think that we can
do better though.
Two sexiest
words a woman can say?
Save me.
What do I win?
I don't love you.
Shadow, take me down with
you for the last time.
For the last time.
I'm hoping I can
change your mind.
Who cares.
So why did you do it then?
Because he knew me.
He knew what I wanted.
He knew who I really am.
With that fuck, not some
Aristotelian proposition.
You don't have to
think about it.
You just do it.
Move, I got it.
OK, Romy, you can
either ask me to help me
or you can tell me how you
want it done, not both.
You can help me organize shit.
You know every time you
come home put your keys
in the same fucking spot.
Every fucking time.
So you wouldn't spend 10
minutes every single morning
running around the
house looking for shit.
You know?
I mean just put things in the
same spot every single time
and then you'd never
look for anything again.
Establish a routine
and stick to it.
Is it so hard?
Is it so fucking
hard to do that,
to have some follow through?
My god, you're stupid.
I mean just throw shit
out that you don't use.
Your never going
to need it again.
It's not fucking brain surgery.
Come on, this isn't about
me looking for my keys
every morning.
You hate me, don't you?
Why do you hate me so much?
Because you love me.
There must be something
so wrong with you.
We always thought you
guys were so happy.
I don't think she has any
clue what that really mean.
Why are you so angry with her?
I'm not.
But I was because she
took you away from me.
No, because... because I
knew she would hurt you.
Just like a record lady.
Just like a record lady.
Just like a record lady.
Just like a record lady.
Just like a record lady.
Just like a record lady.
I told you
I didn't love you
and you said you
were OK with that.
I lied.
What do you want from me, Romy?
I don't know.
A little while ago I would
have said a beautiful now.
And some time of full of
excitement and passion
and life.
But right this second,
I'd settle for some sugar.
Could you get it
for me from the bar?
What the fuck do
you want from me?
What do you want from me?
When did life stop
being beautiful.
No, no, no, no, no.
You see that's the problem.
You never understood.
There's more than
just beautiful.
Life just isn't like
that, Romy, there
are long, fast, stretches
which are just boring.
And that's normal.
Why didn't you do
anything about it?
Because I didn't care.
And you shouldn't either.
I was just so sick of
you moaning about LA winters.
You know it's just
not the same, Romy.
So I don't know.
Marry me.
What?
Marry me.
Does it ever turn out
like we expect it to?
I though you got
what you wanted.
No.
I didn't.
Steve said I'm the
only one he ever loved.
Steve?
When you were working
together on our shoots?
How do I not know this?
You were too busy
changing worlds.
I was busy making
models look pretty.
And Steve was busy doing models.
And then he tell me
he want to be buddies.
And I tell him, no,
it's not how it work.
I suck your dick
you're not my buddy.
Oh, my god.
Now I'm in love with you too.
I think that is the most words
I've ever heard you say, Jaki.
Oh, and here's more.
You walk away from
magazine like it's nothing.
Whoa, OK.
I think I kind of
preferred the less words.
Jaki, I didn't have
anything to say anymore.
You know there was nothing
that I was passionate about.
I think I was depressed.
This is anger,
with no enthusiasm.
You want... how you say this?
Bypass of heart.
Bypass heart.
In my country you
do not give up.
Do you understand?
You cannot be tourist
in your own life.
She doesn't
understand it either.
Exactly.
Hey.
Hey.
Sushi.
Sushi.
Uh, hi.
Hi.
I know I should have
called you, but, uh,
you know on the other hand...
You have the wrong fingers.
Yes.
Uh, so you're getting married.
Yes.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Is it someone that you know?
Funny.
Yeah.
Very funny.
It's super funny.
We met a few months ago.
Her name is Molly.
Of course it is.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
She's safe.
You know it's easy, it's simple.
She worships me.
She doesn't know you.
That's true, but I
don't want her to.
It's easier that way.
Four most infuriating
words... I should have known.
I wonder how you can get
over it one more time.
Believe it one more time.
Keep going one more time.
You have to keep going.
You have no choice.
I learned that growing up.
Oh, that's rich coming
from a girl who grew up
on the mean streets of Hawaii.
Aloha
hi, la, la, la, la.
Hey, asshole, I
grew up in Detroit.
My mom only moved us
to Hawaii after my dad
left the five of us
to fend for ourselves
during the worst winter ever.
I think she figured that if
she had worked three jobs
to support four little girls
that maybe she should do it
in a better climate.
Is that OK with you?
OK but does that
explain why you
can't say one sentence without
the word I or me in it?
I don't.
Enough!
Enough!
Enough!
Newsflash, it is not about you.
If I was her I would be out
here threatening to shoot
the both of you.
I mean I love you guys but
it's been what... seven years
of us hanging out?
And the entire time
I kept wondering
what's wrong with you.
No, let me rephrase that.
I kept wondering
what self-inflicted
psychological drama that
you're going through this time.
Has it ever occurred
to either one of you
that, contrary to
popular belief,
the world does not
revolve around you?
You could've just
told me to shut up.
I did.
You totally go down.
OK, this is now officially
one of the few moments
when I miss taking drugs.
They made me feel
good for no reason.
I mean before they
made me feel worse.
I'm just being honest.
OK?
How clear are you
on the concept, J?
Honest like when you stole
mom's bracelet and pawned it?
Aaron, I tried to get it
back but it was already gone.
Did you know that Dad
ripped the house apart
because he wanted to find it so
he could give it to you to make
you feel better after Mom died.
It is the only thing
that he has left over
and he wanted to give it to you.
He still can't see what his
little golden princesses
is capable of.
Golden princess?
Yes, J, in his
eyes you are still
his gorgeous little
perfect girl.
The pretty one, made people
stop on the street in awe.
What a talent that is.
God, you are such a cheap date.
No wonder even my shy
brother could pick you up.
Hey, are you listening
to me at all?
Hm?
So check it out.
First I thought, I should
write a travel book.
You know because I'm a model.
But then I realized it
had to be a cook book.
You know I love cooking.
You know I do, right?
What?
Yeah.
But you're a model.
What would your recipe be like?
It would be like stick two
fingers down your throat
and spew up everything
that you've ever
eaten in your entire life.
And then chop up
little bits of speed
and put them in
little nice piles.
And then sort them.
And then wash them down
with more champagne.
Ha ha.
No, seriously, would that be it?
Fuck you.
It's amazing how
quickly you can
go from fuck you to fuck me.
Hello?
Hello?
Put down, Romy.
It's plastic.
This place isn't that nice.
You know what they say, when
you run out of champagne
you gotta order more cocktail.
Oh, look, you have champagne.
Romy, put that down.
Why?
Put it down or
you're going to start
french kissing the bar again.
I'd rather kiss you.
That's not funny.
Why is that not funny?
Come here.
What are you doing?
I'm going to give you a kiss.
Fuck me.
I stared out stained
glass windows
but I didn't see anything.
I lived just like a shadow.
I didn't feel anything.
If there's a god in
heaven, won't you
tell him to let me in.
I promise I'll be a good girl.
I promise I won't give in.
And you tell me, baby, I know
that love can get so hard.
Look out that window.
You could be
dancing in the yard.
And I know it's crazy, but
we've got to find a spark.
Keep on burning and we'll
be dancing in the dark.
What's wrong?
I'm Sorry, I can't do this.
Oh, fuck you.
You say that god's in heaven.
He wants to let me in.
I'll promise I'll
be a good girl.
I'll promise I wont give in.
You tell me, baby, I know
that life can get so hard.
From fuck you to fuck me.
We're back again.
What were you thinking, J?
I know I screwed up
on so many levels.
I'm sure I don't
deserve a second chance.
I'm not sure
you do either.
It's funny how
alike you two are.
Me and Ella?
You and Romy.
It's really why you
didn't trust her.
I'm sorry, Aaron.
I'm so sorry.
Hello?
And mothers and fathers.
Yes.
Fathers and mothers.
And fathers and daughters.
You will have such
a good time, my dear.
Romy June, they will love you.
Look at them.
I'm nervous.
Oh, you have nothing
to be nervous about.
All of these people have been
doing this a really long time.
I just started, Dad.
I'm not going to be that good.
How could they not love you?
That's it, go.
I will be here when
you come out, OK?
Promise?
Promise, I will be right here.
I won't go anywhere.
OK.
Love you.
Love you too, June.
That's where I
fell in love with dance.
It never changes.
It has clear rules
and the judgment
is non-negotiable and fair.
That's why it's
better than life.
It's beautiful.
Fathers and
daughters and mothers.
Romy.
Romy, what are you doing here?
Nothing, don't worry.
I just want to walk you home.
Uh, OK.
Can we go visit Daddy?
And fathers and daughters.
Hello?
Yes.
Mom.
No, no, no.
It's for you.
It's the hospital.
I can't.
I can't, I can't.
Yes, I, um, I understand.
Thank you for calling.
Maybe it's ironic
that mama call me Mimi,
like mi, mi, mi.
But then she forgot
to pick me up
at grandparents'
house for 15 years.
Yeah, kind of.
Or is it ironic
that for a month
she call every day
saying she want
to come to America
for first fashion show
because she is a
lonely and broke.
And then, forget
to get on plane I
pay for because she
has new boyfriend.
Elle, what would you say?
Screw you.
What she is trying to
express so eloquently,
Jaki, is that a lot
of women do that.
They try so hard to be
in a new relationship
that they forget the ones
that they're already in.
And then they
forget themselves.
They give away their freedom.
What's going on, Elle?
What's wrong.
There's nothing wrong
with being married.
And there is nothing wrong
with living in Newport Beach.
And there's nothing
wrong with me.
Then, well, why are you crying?
Because when we
all used to hang out
I used to think that
when I get to my future,
like when I get out of
LA or out of the job
that I thought I
hated, I thought
that I would have a
present that I liked.
I just find myself
missing my past.
Oh, I find that there's
parts of my past I
just... I don't want to miss.
So Romy, Romina Saudi.
You don't look Iranian.
Anyway, you're here
for the cleaning job.
Excellent.
And when can you start?
How much do you pay?
A cleaning job,
flipping burgers,
selling lace at that
department store...
all these jobs taught
me something invaluable.
That hard work pays off?
That beauty gives you power.
So if I paid you $200 to take
some pictures would you do it?
Just pictures, nothing else.
You are so beautiful.
You're such a beautiful girl.
Just pictures?
Just pictures.
Suddenly, I understand.
Even at 12 years
old, you can discover
that you have power
when you thought
you were completely powerless.
I finally felt powerful.
Baby, I'm
so sorry I can't help you.
I'm not feeling so good.
I'm going to go lay down.
I know.
Could you take a
look at these for me?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
How did I miss that?
Well, you weren't
around anymore.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because she didn't
want you to know.
I know but I not understand.
No.
I hate this.
No, we need custom invitation.
Tell me, who has love
best represented by kitten
coming out of shoe?
What is going on?
I don't know,
it's Beverly Hills.
They probably found out there
was carbs in the water supply
and there was a mass exodus.
I just feel so totally weird.
You know?
Like... it's like I'm
drowning and I just, I can't.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know what
the fuck I'm doing.
Romy, you love Aaron, no?
Yeah.
And Aaron loves you.
Yeah.
Yes, and we will
make beautiful party.
There's hair on chin.
What?
Young lady!
Get it.
Get it.
It's like plucking
stray eyebrow.
Ow!
That is not like
plucking a stray eyebrow.
I think I'm a shape-shifter.
I become whoever
you want me to be.
You are far from
what I want you to be.
Now, stop.
Stop drinking.
I can't take it.
Otherwise you'll be french
kissing the tiles again.
Why does everyone
always think that I
am into heavy petting
with inanimate objects?
Huh?
I actually hate those tiles.
Do you know how long
we've been together now?
I don't know.
Five years, nine months,
29 days, and 10 minutes.
Just so we are clear, I know.
And it doesn't matter.
What?
It doesn't matter.
None of it mattered
to you and I'm still
here planning a wedding.
So how do you know
that you matter?
I do because I can
see past your bullshit.
You make me crazy, you make
me happy, and I love you.
Just don't do it again, Romy, or
I'm going to have to kill you.
I met you.
You should tell them
that you fucked the guy I
loved with me in the next room.
Oh, yeah, that.
Yeah.
He's here.
Romy, he's here.
He's here.
He is walking up the
driveway right now.
He is walking up the driveway.
He looks so good.
OK, OK, honey, breathe.
Hey, what's up?
Hi.
How's it going?
Good.
How are you?
Good.
You look good.
Thanks.
You too.
David, can you hear me?
Are you there?
Oh, I'm sorry.
What did you say?
I got to go so
just call me later.
OK.
All right, bye.
OK.
Yep.
So who's this guy?
What's happening?
Why am I here?
Because I need you to tell
me what you think about him
OK.
I have not felt
this way in like 10 years.
Not since that asshole who
shall remain nameless, James.
And I thought I liked it
like that, but I don't.
I don't.
And I don't know,
it's like ever since I
met Chris I just feel again.
And I love it.
I feel like I'm waking up
to life again or something.
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah,
Oh, my god.
I just... I want him
to be my best friend.
He inspires me.
I want him to... I just
want to be in his life.
I want him to be in my life.
I want him to be my life.
And can you please stop
giving me one word answers?
Is that possible?
OK.
OK, you can come out now.
You've made your point.
Does that count
that it goes up?
I guess so.
Yes, that's three
sevens in a row.
Two, three, four, five,
six, seven, seven, seven.
You're so good at this.
I know.
You're so good at this.
I gotta go.
You have to go what?
Number two?
I'm gonna go.
I got to go.
You don't have to go.
Yeah, I gotta go.
What, why?
Why do you have to go?
Because it's time to go.
Oh, just, hang on.
No, no, no.
Please stay.
Please, please, will
you talk to him?
He's so nice to me but I
need to know more about him.
OK?
And he'll tell you
He'll talk to you.
Everybody talks to you.
I love you.
Man, you really
tore my heart out
and stomped that sucker flat.
Why isn't Chris calling me?
Do you think... you
know what I think?
I think I came... I
come on too strong.
I did.
You know I think
you should call him.
Yes, definitely.
You should call him for me.
Answer it.
Answer it.
Answer it, answer it.
Please, please,
please, please, please.
Answer it and tell
him to come see you.
Tell him to see you.
Answer it.
Answer it.
How could you not know that
she was in love with you?
Look at you.
What is this fuzz?
When are you going
to learn to shave?
I would like to say its
fashion but it's laziness.
Look at you.
Hi.
This is our friend Chris.
Oh!
Could you be any cuter?
Oh, gosh, look at you.
Come on.
Leave those.
Leave those.
It's OK.
It is so nice to
finally meet you, Romy.
David has talked
so much about you
and he never mentions
any of his girlfriends.
Oh, really?
I mean his father and I
had almost given up hope.
Wow, so you're still
not out to your parents?
I had no idea.
That explains so much about you.
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
Like why you don't have a life.
I mean it would take a lot
to clear that up for you.
Well, the night is young.
Yes, but you're not.
That's good.
What are you saying?
I'm not saying anything.
Do you have something
in your nose?
In my nose?
Oh, come on.
Salty.
But it was good.
I loved Chris.
He had really clear
eyes, like a baby.
Aw, yes.
Like baby cow that lost mama.
Like Bambi.
Yeah, there was just
no malice in them.
Wait, were you guys
all just sitting around
staring into Chris's eyes?
That's not creepy
to anybody but me?
What was he like 12,
15, 18, one of those?
He was sweet.
I think, I mean I only
met him the one time.
I don't know how
I'm hungry again.
You do not understand.
Just everything was starting
to fall apart, David.
No, you just
found a good excuse
to do whatever you wanted
without any consideration
for me, for us.
You know I will never
trust you again.
You can't ever get that back.
Oh, maybe I should just teach.
No, you love doing it too much.
Yeah, well, there's that.
Mm hm.
OK, he likes you, you like him.
Do whatever you want.
It's cool, I'm fine.
Seriously.
Totally.
I know it's getting
a little damp in here.
Why do you think they call
it happy hour when not one
person here looks happy?
Hey, look at this
girl right here.
Are you looking?
She looks happy though.
No, she looks pretty happy.
Yeah, but I'm
pretty sure there are
clowns out there thinking maybe
a little too much face paint.
I don't know.
Maybe she was thinking better
well made-up then marked
for life.
Are you marked for life, Romy?
Yes.
Aren't we all?
That
it could last so long.
Every day that passes by, our
love it still stays strong.
How could I have known that
I would sing you this song?
Happy Anniversary.
Happy Anniversary.
You know I think you had
every right to be angry,
but you had no
right to be cruel.
Hey.
Six hours to think of something
to say and all you can think of
is hey.
Shit.
David, what the fuck?
You said, you said that
this is what you wanted.
Yeah, right.
This is what you wanted.
It is not the same
thing that I want.
You said that I should do this.
You said thing you were fine.
Yeah, OK.
Maybe I just thought you'd
have heart enough to care.
OK, OK.
So you say one thing,
expect me to understand
that it means something
else, and then
you want me to do a third?
What are you, like, the
fucking oracle of Delphi?
Now what?
So I don't know what's
going on with you guys
but I want you to know that I
love you both very, very much.
These have, uh... these
has been the best
four months of my life.
Basically, I don't know what
to do right now so I'm just
going to go.
Don't fuck this up.
OK?
Just go.
Please, just go away.
I was talking to you, Romy.
You're going to miss me.
How can I miss you if
you won't ever go away?
Could somebody
get me some water?
I feel like I'm
going to throw up.
Congratulations, sweetheart.
You know you're pregnant, right?
No.
Yeah.
No.
No.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
What am I going to do?
Well, you put
everything on hold
and make little person priority.
And...
Find out that he thinks you
completely ruined his life.
And then wonder what
happened to yours?
Oh, David can be fun uncle who
take little person on protest
walks.
Oh, yeah.
I could take him
to football games
and teach him how
to play baseball.
Man, you really
failed homo 101.
No fashion sense, hates interior
decorating, loves football.
I'm going to be a mom.
I gotta go.
OK.
I hope
you won't forget us.
And I hope you feel that
despite everything we
taught you something.
Important things.
Like the reasons Prince is sexy.
That there is a difference
between cream, off-white,
and ivory.
That a salad with no
dressing, a diet coke,
and a hot fudge sundae
make a nutritious lunch.
Why a call between David and me
never lasts under 30 minutes.
That crying can be fun.
And that we will miss you.
It's weird.
I've been looking for something
my whole life that makes sense
and now it's finally here.
What?
Do I have something on my face?
You look happy.
I don't think I've
ever seen that before.
You didn't ever,
you know, love me?
Before Romy, of course.
Even a teeny tiny bit?
Not really.
It's funny, I always thought
that you were the answer
I wasn't even the question.
Mm.
Hang
on to that feeling.
Hang on to that feeling.
Don't you ever let it slip away.
Hang on to that feeling.
Hang on to that feeling.
Don't you ever let it slip away.
Bah!
Cockroach!
Cockroach!
Where?
Where?
What do we do?
Where's it at?
Right there.
I see it.
I see it.
I see it.
Oh, god.
Did you get it.
Oh, my god.
Look at this.
Is it Romy's old shit?
Look at this.
It's you.
It's me,
my first cover.
Can I look at it?
Roach killer.
Look at that,
your wedding announcement.
Yeah, she's a
borderline hoarder.
Aaron.
Aw, look, when
Bernie had dignity.
David Hamm.
Oh, my god.
You can't make this up, can you?
I think I'm going
to write about this.
What, her armpits?
Yes, Jessica, her armpits.
No!
I mean this, tonight, all of us.
You, me, getting older, saving
a friend, saving the world.
Hm, you're very
pretty, Jessica.
Thank you.
It's been mentioned.
Ella, how come
you've never asked
me one question about
myself in seven years?
Not one.
Not how many brothers
and sisters I have.
Where do I...
Brother... Drew.
Assistant manager,
works at Geek Squad.
Your brother, Steve, he works
a DMV in North Carolina.
Your sister, Eleanor, she
started a pet nanny service
to the stars in Atlanta
and then it went national.
Well, it's Andrew and Steven.
Not Drew and Steve.
What's the first
thing I said when
I walked in Robert's house?
Hi, money, I'm home.
I was joking.
I know.
Hey!
Do you remember
the text that
sent me after I left
you like 900 messages
begging you to call me back?
Yep, it said if your phone
doesn't ring, that's me.
Next time I saw you
was at the memorial.
You know that?
I found one of those words
where you change one letter
and it changes everything.
Yeah?
Ignoranus... someone who is
stupid and also an asshole.
Congratulations.
What kills me is that the kid
loved us both and I told him
I didn't want to
be friends anymore.
And he forgave me.
He's a better person
than either you or me.
Yeah, but that's easy.
Where are
you running, sweetheart?
I see you trying
to get there fast.
What are you hoping
for, sweetheart?
Where are you
running, sweetheart?
What are running?
There fast.
Was just lonely without
you guys, wasn't it?
It's nice to have family back
together again, isn't it?
Hey, honey, it's me.
Happy birthday.
So I'm here at the
theater, you're not.
Multiple choice, what's
wrong with this picture?
Oh, my god, you guys actually
wear floss as a costume.
Damn, I wish my brain
could unknow this.
OK, well, call me back.
Hey, you got anything?
No.
Damn.
Wanna smoke?
I don't smoke.
Wait a minute,
aren't you David?
Closeted writer, human chimney?
No, David, teacher,
out and proud,
and militant nonsmoker for
actually four months now.
That's weird.
How come she doesn't
know about this?
I mean she talks about
you all the fricking time.
You know what?
You annoyed me before
I ever met you.
Yeah, it's a gift I have.
Prick.
Five
minutes to showtime.
Five minutes to showtime.
Now.
I want to hold you in my hand.
White light, sing
your love to me.
I am a stranger in your world.
White light, do you
still dream of me?
I am so lonely in this world.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Come here.
I want to hold you in my hand.
I knew you could figure it out.
The truth
is, I was mad at her at first.
But then I realized
life is so brief.
You know?
We're here, we're gone.
It won't ever be perfect.
We all believe that we
will live a million years
and it doesn't matter
how much time we waste.
But we're like plants,
we flourish and we die.
It's not that complicated.
Wait!
Do you remember when you
dressed up as a UPS man
and delivered a package
to Aaron just so you
could see what he looked like?
And do you remember
when you signed me up
to be a pet nanny
to the stars so I'd
stop trying to be a dancer?
Do you remember when you made me
crash my car outside that guy's
house so he'd come out and save
us, and he wasn't even home?
Yeah.
I love that about you.
It was worth it.
Every second of it.
7:05, Romy, showtime.
Everybody's got
a secret to hide.
Everyone is slipping backwards.
I can't remember if
I like what I said.
I can't remember it went
straight to my head.
I kept a bottle by
the foot of the bed.
I put a pillow on top of my
head but I killed for love.
I killed for love.
Killed for love.
Everybody's got
a secret to hide.
Everyone is slipping backwards.
You say you see it
almost every time.
A little number
counting back to nine.
I can't remember if
I like what I said.
I can't remember it went
straight to my head.
But I killed for love.
I killed for love.
Killed for love."
15,A Beautiful Place to Die: A Martha's Vineyard Mystery (2020) - full transcript,A retired Boston PD detective and the acting medical examiner at Martha's Vineyard work together to solve the murder of a mysterious young man.,"Ah, great meal.
So how's sailing class going?
It's going really well, Dad.
Yeah. You'd...
you'd really enjoy it.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I did it, you know, back in the day.
Oh, yeah?
How about jellyfish?
You ever been stung by one of those?
Yeah. It's...
What's wrong, Dad?
Oh...
Must be hearing things.
Okay... here we go.
You know, crowding a man's fishing spot
is usually frowned upon around here.
Public beach.
Besides...
looks like you're getting skunked anyway.
Nah. Got a 34-inch blue
in the back of the truck.
Besides, shouldn't you be out protecting
the fine people of the Vineyard
from dangerous criminals?
Well, that's why I'm here.
Got a call there was a 2-11 in progress,
some ""tourist""
stealin' all the fish.
Why don't you try this one, Chief?
Sandstriker 750.
Just came out.
I'll stick with mine, thanks.
Suit yourself.
Hate to see you go home empty-handed.
Again.
Watch and learn, J.W.
Good luck.
I'm on duty,
but there's a fundraising gala
up at the yacht club tonight.
Might be worth cleaning up for.
Eh, you know that's not my cup of tea.
Besides, collared shirts make my neck itch.
Zee will be there.
I'll catch you later, Chief.
Yeah.
âª The only road I've walked âª
âª The only path I've known âª
âª Well, it's still taking me nowhere âª
âª There's nowhere left to call home âª
âª Oh-oh... âª
âª And I feel the light is changing âª

Enjoy.
Good morning, Bob.
What's the good word?
The coffee's hot and the weather's fine.
You have a chance
to check out that big sailboat
at the end of the dock?
That Rhodes 77?
Fully restored?
Beautiful boat.
Arrived from the mainland on Thursday.
Haven't met the owners yet, somehow.
Hmm. One bluefish fillet.
Very nice.
Seems like a fair trade.
How's your dad's boat coming along?
Mm. Slowly.
Like father, like son, I guess.
Well, your dad never rushed a project.
He never seemed to finish one, either.
Well, as John Foster Dulles once said,
""A man's accomplishments in life
are the cumulative effect
of his attention to detail.""
Secretary of State Eisenhower.
Smart man.
Sure, Bob.
Whatever you say.
Jeff!
Jeff!
Judy.
What can I do for you today?
Well, is there any chance
you can you take a look at my outboard?
It turns over,
but I-it just keeps quitting.
Sure.
So I called Ted over,
and Ted helped me put this up here,
but he couldn't get it running.
Well, let's take a look.
You know, if the engine's turning over,
you're probably getting a spark.
Uh-huh?
- Maybe just not enough fuel.
- Oh.
Thank you so much, Jeff.
It's really kind of you.
Just what I thought,
your fuel filter's clogged.
Oh!
Beautiful boat.
Did you restore it yourself?
No.
Who did the work?
It's, uh, it's impressive.
Uh, some guy in Boston.
Is that where you're sailing in from?
Yeah, Charlestown Marina.
Ah.
Bradley! You made it.
Uh-huh.
- Great day for a sail.
- Oh, definitely.
- Good to see you.
- You too, man.
I told you this was beautiful.
It is that.
This must be your sister, Stacy.
How'd you guess?
Well... what do you guys
want to drink?
We got it all.
Come on in!
I still think this is weird.
You've known this guy, what?
Three days?
Oh, come on, Stacy.
I'm just saying...
Must be nice...
sailing around on your rich daddy's dime.
Wouldn't know.
Well, that should get you going...
Ah.
You should probably change this filter.
And I'd check the fuel tank.
I think there's some dirt in there.
Okay.
Oh!
Oh! Oh, Jeff!
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Oh, thank you!
Oh, you should probably
get that checked out, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
You have a good one, Judy.
Thank you!
Again, sorry for the mess,
we're doing some last-minute touch-ups,
but I wanted you to get
a first look at the new wing,
funded entirely by
Harriet's Hope Foundation.
Dr. Madieras.
Hi, Payton.
Welcome.
So, follow me, but please be careful.
With the construction,
I don't want anyone getting hurt.
Jeff Jackson.
Zee Madieras.
This is certainly a surprise.
So you're back from New York.
Uh, a few years ago.
What about you, what are you
doing on the island?
Moved here about a month ago.
My dad's old place.
""Doctor"" Madieras.
Yeah, imagine that.
What about you?
I heard you were a detective
with the Boston PD?
I was.
Early retirement.
Why's that?
Missed fishing on the Vineyard.
Oh, yeah?
Is that how you hurt your back?
Fishing on the Vineyard?
No. Uh, it just goes out
sometimes.
Okay.
My doctor back in Boston
would give me a cortisone shot
when it acted up like this.
Since you're a new patient here,
I can't give you a shot
until I've taken an x-ray.
Is that really necessary?
Yes. Stand up.
I'll take a look.
Ooh.
Recent surgery?
Six months ago.
And what'll I see on the x-ray here?
Some pins holding your vertebrae together?
No.
A bullet.
I'm guessing this is the real reason
for your early retirement.
They tried to dig it out,
and then decided
it was too close to your spinal cord?
You know your way around an x-ray.
I also worked for seven months
in New York City
at the Coroner's office,
so I've done enough autopsies
to know what a bullet can do to a body.
You know, if this decides
to migrate closer to your spine,
it could damage nerves.
Possibly leave you disabled.
So I've been told.
What were you doing exactly
that aggravated it?
Just being neighborly.
You need to be careful with this.
Yeah, I know.
So how about that cortisone shot?
Let's give it a few days,
see how you're doing.
Listen, I'll book you for a follow-up soon,
to make sure that the inflammation
doesn't get any worse.
You're the doctor.
I am the doctor!
So no more friendly repairs.
Doctor's orders.
Hi. How did it go?
They love it.
Happy to see their donations
put to good use.
Great! Um, Jeff,
this is Payton Bartel.
This is Jeff Jackson.
She runs the foundation
that funded the new wing.
Nice to meet you.
You too. You know,
we have our annual gala
at the Yacht Club tonight.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard.
You should come.
Zee, you'll be there, right?
I wouldn't miss it.
I appreciate the offer.
It's for a great cause.
- I'm sure.
- See you tonight.
Bye.
That was a very polite ""no.""
Nothing personal.
Well, it starts at 8:30,
if you change your mind.
It'd be nice to catch up.
It's good to see you, Zee.
Hey, Jeff?
I was really sorry to hear about your dad.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Hey. Is my Dad in?
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi!
Knock-knock.
- Hey.
- Brought you some strudel.
Oh...
Hey, you know,
the county will pay
for speech-recognition software
so you don't have to torture
yourself with that keyboard.
What're you talking about?
I'm much faster
than I used to be.
Oh, yeah, you're lightning fast.
Anyway...
I'm not about to ask for special favors.
At least not until they renew my contract.
Dad, the board's gonna re-elect you.
Everyone loves you.
Hey, I saw Jeff Jackson today, finally.
He came into the clinic.
- Is that so?
- Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me the real
reason for his retirement?
Well, you doctors have
your patient confidentiality,
we cops have a code.
Well.
So I take it I'm not going
to see you at the gala tonight.
Oh, lots of paperwork.
All right.
Plus, at the speed you type,
we're gonna need to put a cot in here.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Have fun.
- Thank you!
âª The sun will set late in the day âª
âª Chase it across the open road âª
âª Only do it free Can't be another way âª
âª We won't stop until we hit the coast âª
âª 'Cause the tide may roll âª
âª And the wind may blow... âª
What am I doing?
âª ...But you've got to
take her easy to get along âª
I'm sure the Percys know
all about the Pendray, Britt.
I just want them to think of us
the next time they plan
one of these functions.
...But I don't understand
why the I.R.S. is asking at all.
I'm gonna meet with Payton tomorrow,
and I'll get to the bottom
of it, I promise.
There's Helena Percy.
Ahh...
- Okay.
- Helena!
What a wonderful party you've put together.
Britt, how lovely to see you.
Dr. Madieras.
You know Gerald Martin?
His firm handles the accounts
for Harriet's Hope.
Doctor, you patched up my son
a couple years ago.
I remember. You sent me
a really lovely note.
Helena,
I wanted to tell you
that we're now doing events at the Pendray.
Um, I'd...
I'd love to send you a...
What is she doing here?
Jackie Shawl.
That article about the foundation...
she wrote that.
I was wondering
if I can ask you a few questions.
Well, if you'll excuse us,
we need to go find my husband.
Of course.
Well, that went well.
Jeff, this is the second time
you've surprised me today.
Well, you said it was for a good cause.
Not sure I look the part, though.
Yeah, did you get dressed in the dark?
That bad?
No, it's not that bad.
Hello.
Um, Jeff, this is my friend,
Britt Prajna, she runs the Pendray Hotel.
This is Jeff Jackson.
Nice to meet you.
And how do you two know each other?
Blame it our dads.
They were, uh, best friends.
Jeff used to spend
his summers out here during high school.
We used to hang out with
some of the same people.
Well, hey, I'm gonna do a livestream.
Let's all say hi.
How about I grab us some drinks?
Ray?
What are you doing here?
I came here to talk to your Dad.
We told you, it's not a good time.
Okay.
Who does this guy think he is?
I don't know.
This is just a joke.
And why haven't I met him before?
Because we haven't seen
each other since we were 18.
So...?
It's not like that.
Uh-huh.
It's not, I'm serious.
We were like oil and water.
Maybe there was a kiss, once.
Ms. Shawl, while
we appreciate your interest
in Harriet's Hope,
we believe it's inappropriate
for you to be here.
Sorry, I don't think I understand.
Oh, I believe you do,
and we'd appreciate it if you would leave
before we begin our program.
Are you kicking me out?
No.
Not at all.
Jackie, we'd love you to stay.
Um, maybe some positive coverage
for Harriet's Hope
would be appreciated.
Stay and enjoy.
I have something to show the two of you.
Come with me.
- That was weird.
- Mm.
Thanks.
Mr. Martin?
Hi. I've been meaning
to speak to you about something.
Oh? And you are?
Dad, Helena says they're going onstage now.
- Oh!
- I, uh, I really just...
I'll catch you later.
Buddy.
You can see he's busy.
Yeah, I just need a second.
No. We need to talk.
No, we don't.
I came here to talk to your...
You show up here uninvited.
Completely...
We need to talk.
We both know why you're here.
Just step outdoors, okay?
Step outdoors.
Kind of a weird vibe in here tonight.
Tense.
...with my dad...
I didn't feel like I needed to.
I'm not gonna tell you...
- Hey! Get your hands off me!
- Don't touch me!
- Get your hands off me!
- No, no!
Hey! Hey, hey.
That's enough.
Take it outside.
Yeah, that's right, Ray.
Let's take it outside.
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention, please?
I would like to welcome you
to the fifth annual Harriet's Hope Gala.
Thank you.
I'm Payton Bartel,
Executive Director of Harriet's Hope,
a foundation started by my father
after the death of my mother, Harriet,
to help families impacted by illness.
And while we helped many people
in those early days,
our reach was short,
until two very special people
joined our board of directors...
Mr. Thomas Percy,
our board president,
and his wonderful wife, Helena,
our fund development chair.
So please...
give a warm welcome
to Mr. Thomas Percy.
Payton has kindly given us the credit,
but the credit
really belongs to everyone here.
It's because of your generosity
that our success is even possible,
so eat, drink, be merry...
And dance!
Yes. Please dance.
As long as you don't have
two left feet, like me...
You know...
someone once said to me,
""To love and be loved
is everything.""
So, thank you, everyone
for showing us your love...
and allowing us to spread it far and wide.
Enjoy the evening.
Okay, guys, let's get this picture.
Get a selfie.
So, Jeff, having a good time?
Sure. It's, uh,
it's nice to get out.
Well, we'll have more fun
on the dance floor.
Let's all go.
Thanks, but I'm not much of a dancer.
Did we just find the one thing
Jeff Jackson isn't good at?
You know, it's just
I don't think my doctor would approve.
She's very strict.
Okay! So...
just us girls then?
Guess so.
Come on, Zee.
Have fun.
Kelly!
What'd you do,
work on your dad's boat all night?
Feels like it.
As a local sage recently told me,
""A man's accomplishments in life
are the cumulative effect
of his attention to detail.""
Sounds like my kinda guy.
- Thanks, Bob.
- My pleasure.
Morning.
Huh.
Blood.
Okay, put him down here.
Will everyone move back, please?
O'Connor, I'm gonna need
some more help down here.
You know, you might want to reference
a tides map of Vineyard Sound
from the N.O.A.A.
The current must've brought him in
from somewhere nearby.
Uh, yeah.
Good idea. Thanks.
Is Chief Madieras coming down?
Oh, actually, there he is.
Jeff.
Probably not how
you wanted to start your day.
No. I'd rather
be pulling bluefins
out of the water right now.
Want to tell us where you found him?
Yeah, I found a jacket over
down on the rocks, by Bob's.
Started to look around,
and found him stuck
up against those pilings.
Any I.D. on him?
No, sir.
I'm pretty sure his name's Ray.
He was staying on that Rhodes 77
down near the end of the dock.
You talked to him?
A bit.
I also saw him last night.
Ah, here she is.
She's my acting M.E.
Zee is your acting M.E.?
What are you, moonlighting?
I'm the only doctor on the island
who has autopsy experience.
What about you?
I thought you were retired.
He found the body.
Ah.
Okay, let's see here.
He looks familiar.
Yeah, he was at the gala last night.
Arguing with those two other kids.
Oh, yeah, I saw that.
That was Bradley and Stacy Martin.
This guy was arguing
with Gerald Martin's kids?
Yeah.
Might want to talk to them
before they lawyer up.
You don't think it might've
been a simple drowning?
Had too much to drink at the party,
went for a walk?
""Long walk off a short pier""?
I don't think so, Chief.
Oh, wait a minute.
There's a laceration
on the back of his head.
Maybe he smacked it against the dock
on his way down?
That way, it could be the blow
and not the water
that killed him.
It's possible.
He's wearing a ring.
It's a graduation ring.
""Class of '85.""
He had boat keys in his pocket.
I can show you the boat.
All right, let's go.
It's just over here.
No obvious signs of foul play.
And if he'd gone over the side here,
the current would've taken him
in the other direction.
Came in alone, big boat like this?
I didn't see anyone else with him,
except when he took the Martin kids out.
Anyone here?
Martha's Vineyard Police!
Open up!
Hey, Chief.
Take a look at this.
Looks like a yearbook.
I'll call a judge and get a search warrant,
and I'll get Jenkins busy
looking up the hull number.
Sounds like you got it handled.
Good luck.
Hey, we're gonna need you
to come down to the station
this afternoon
so we can get
an official statement from you.
All right.
Hey! Jeff?
Hi!
What's going on?
Everything okay over there?
Listen, do me a favor, Judy.
You see anyone else taking
an interest in this boat,
you give me a call.
Sorry, just one second.
Dr. Madieras, where's Mae?
I'm acting M.E. this week.
I don't suppose you could at least tell me
if the victim drowned or...
No comment for now.
Come on, Zee.
You gotta give me something.
""Vineyard...
Haven...
High.""
Let's see.
What do we got here?
""Vineyard Haven 25-year
high-school reunion...""
""Popular Vineyard Haven
teacher retires...""
""Vineyard Haven alum
donate 50 new computers.""
""The donation was spearheaded
by Gerald Martin,
Vineyard Haven
class of '85.""
Hmm.
Chief!
Gerald.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
I wanted to have a chat
with Brad and Stacy, if they're home.
No, I don't think so.
They took the ferry to the mainland today
to see a concert in Boston.
I don't expect them till tomorrow.
Mm, kids these days, huh?
Aw, you know.
Yeah, come on in.
Can I, uh, ask what this is about?
A friend of theirs
was found dead this morning.
Dead?
I'm real sorry to hear that.
You know who it was?
We haven't positively identified him yet,
that's why I need to talk to your kids.
We know they went sailing
with him yesterday,
and they talked to him
at the Harriet's Hope Gala last night.
You're not suggesting
my kids had anything to do
with his death?
I'm not suggesting anything.
I just need to speak to them.
How about I come by again
tomorrow afternoon?
Sure.
I'll tell 'em to expect you.
Great. Thanks, Gerald.
Right...
Yeah, sure.
What is that?
Gotcha.
Okay, so you saw the body in the water,
and then you called 9-1-1,
and then what did you do?
I waited.
Look, have you looked up
the hull number of that boat yet?
Uh, yeah, but it isn't
registered to anyone named Ray.
Well, who's it registered to?
Um... I don't think
I'm allowed to tell you that.
I'm guessing this is the printout
of the registration.
And now I can see
that the owner of the boat's
name is Donovan Fletcher.
I've heard that name before.
Excuse me.
- Hey, Sara.
- Oh, hey, Zee.
- Is my Dad in his office?
- Uh-huh.
Dad, I found something you have to see.
It's a small splinter of glass
that I found in the laceration wound
on the victim's head.
You know what this means?
It sounds like he was murdered.
So this Ray kid didn't drown?
He was murdered.
That's what your official
report's gonna say?
It's going to say that the cause of death
was blunt-force trauma to the head,
likely from something made of glass,
or with a glass component.
And you're sure he didn't fall
onto or through
something made of glass?
No, the angle of impact
makes that unlikely.
Then whoever killed him
must have dumped his body
in the ocean after the fact.
So you got a graduation ring,
and the Vineyard Haven
yearbook on the boat...
both from the class of 1985.
I got curious...
so I looked up the class of '85...
and I found this online.
And Gerald Martin
was in the Vineyard Haven class of 1985.
And last night, when I was at the bar,
Ray came up to introduce himself
to Gerald Martin,
and the Martin kids were right there,
doing their best
to literally drag him away.
But wait...
if they were trying to protect
their father from Ray,
why would they get on a sailboat with him?
Sir? Uh...
Detective... Jeff,
he thought I should run priors
on the sailboat owner Donovan Fletcher?
Oh, he did?
- What'd you find?
- A lot of arrests.
Mainly in Boston.
Grand larceny, fraud, extortion,
I've got his mug shot.
He was there last night, too.
Right next to me, at the bar.
Run a search for his known associates.
Yes, sir.
So Ray's sailing around on a boat
owned by this guy Fletcher.
H-He's hunting down Gerald Martin,
using his kids to get to him,
and somehow he gets bashed in the head.
You got your work cut out for you.
Well, I'll let you get to it then.
Jeff, wait. Um...
This investigation looks like
it's gonna be a lot more complex
than usual.
What do you mean, usual?
We've had one homicide
on the island in 12 years.
Right.
We're not exactly swimming
in experience here,
and you've worked how many homicides?
Too many.
Yeah, we could really use your help.
You could lend us
your expertise, maybe help steer the case?
That's a really good idea.
No, it's-it's not.
I'm-I'm retired.
Not by choice.
You're still a detective.
Otherwise, you never would've
brought us this.
Okay, yeah, you know, my mind goes there,
but I can't work this case.
I'm not a cop anymore.
And besides...
I'm done with all that.
Oh, what, you don't care about
catching the bad guy anymore?
Really?
You don't even know what you're asking me.
You think I don't know
what I'm asking, but I do.
I know where you got that bullet
you're carrying around.
You know, your Dad used to tell me
that people rarely do
what they're great at,
what they love.
They do what's easiest...
...And spent the rest
of their lives regretting it.
Oh, I remember.
You really gonna play the ""Dad"" card?
There's a killer
running around this island...
Then hire a real detective.
I can give you a few names.
Thanks.
You're right.
I'm sorry I put you on the spot.
This case is mine.
Not yours.
Uh, Chief?
Gerald Martin is on hold for you.
He wants to know if you want
to come back out to the house
and speak to his kids?
Thanks, Jeff.
Jackie Shawl?
Your office told me I could find you here.
Something about a board meeting?
Yes, well, they barred me from sitting in.
And you are...?
Jeff Jackson.
Doing some research for Chief Madieras.
I wanted to ask you
about an article you wrote.
What can you tell me about Gerald Martin?
Well, it's interesting you ask.
Why should I answer?
Found a body this morning.
At the pier.
You're the one who found the body?
And I recognized him as someone
who was trying pretty hard
to talk to Gerald Martin
at the gala last night.
Gerald Martin.
I see.
Well, then we definitely should talk.
But if you can just hold on one minute...
Helena! I know
you don't want to talk to me,
but you and your husband cannot
dodge my questions forever!
Jackie,
this is not a good time
for Helena right now.
Her car was stolen at the gala last night.
She's very upset.
Isn't that the least of her problems?
If you have questions,
you're welcome to ask me.
It seems to me
that you'd be more angry
about the allegations
by the I.R.S.
than anyone.
Well, if I thought they were true,
I would be, but I don't believe it.
How could I?
I'll tell you what...
I will talk to Thomas,
and have him back to you at
the end of the afternoon, okay?
When you came by earlier, Chief,
I had no idea
that Brad and Stacy had
ditched their trip to Boston.
It's true.
We didn't tell him we changed our minds.
So, why don't you tell me how you met Ray,
if that's his name.
That's...
That's the name he told us...
Did he give you a last name?
No.
Where'd you meet him?
At the bar in the yacht club
on Tuesday.
He came up to me,
we started talking, he bought me a beer,
and said I had to go see his boat,
and so we went down there,
saw the boat, it was pretty cool,
then he said to come back next time
with my sister.
Why do you think he wanted you
to bring your sister?
I don't know, she came up
in the conversation,
and I thought he was being polite,
so I-I asked her.
And I had nothing better to do,
so I went, too,
although if I'd known
it was gonna be so weird,
- I wouldn't...
- ""Weird,"" how?
He was just...
kind of nervous,
like smiling too much or something,
but I guess it was fine at first.
But then he starts talking about our dad,
and he's asking all these nosy questions...
Super-intrusive,
and we were thinking,
""This is not cool.""
And we bring up the gala,
and he's, like,
""I want to go meet your Dad.""
And we told him no,
because now we're thinking,
okay, this guy really is weird,
and then he shows up there anyway.
I thought I'd led
a complete stalker to my dad,
so we-we got him out of there
as fast as we could.
So you got him to leave?
Yeah, I...
We got him out of there,
and we sort of stood guard
outside for a little while,
and he left, yeah.
Did he tell you
why he was so interested
in meeting your father?
Any idea why this kid
was so determined to talk to you?
Well, people always want something from me.
They want me to give them a job,
or invest in their company.
Who knows?
Hmm.
Okay. Thanks.
My friend at the Globe knows you,
she says you're one of the good ones.
So I tell you my story,
and you tell me about the body you found?
That's the deal.
A month ago, I got an anonymous
tip about Harriet's Hope.
This person had been
working there a long time,
and said that she believed
someone was skimming money
from the foundation.
A lotof money.
She said
over a million dollars had gone missing
in the time that she was working there.
Whew!
I know.
So I began asking questions
and, of course, got nothing but denial,
so... and you can't
tell anyone this...
I took it to the I.R.S.,
and they actually started looking into it.
Did they find proof?
Well, the I.R.S. can't comment
on an ongoing investigation.
But it seems to me that to be able
to skim money over the long term,
you have to have access to their books.
And guess who owns the accounting firm
that keeps their books?
Gerald Martin.
Paper?
Well, best of luck finding out
who that kid was.
I have one more question for you.
Sure. Go ahead.
You ever hear of a guy
by the name of Donovan Fletcher?
No. No.
Can't say that I have.
Well, thanks for your time, Gerald.
Sure.
A three.
Well, you're looking very doctor-y.
Thank you.
Uh, can you give me a sec?
Yeah.
'Kay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Um...
I owe you an apology
for pushing you so hard.
No, you don't.
Don't ever apologize
for doing everything you can
to catch the bad guy.
So you do still care.
Of course I do.
I mean, it was my whole life.
- For a long time.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
It's just that you've been
through a lot, and...
Zee, stop.
I'm not a wounded bird.
And this isn't gonna work
if you're gonna treat me like one.
What's not gonna work?
I'm in.
I'm gonna help
you and your dad work the case.
Tch. Oh.
Where do we start?
First thing tomorrow,
we start where the victim
was last seen alive.
The yacht club.
Okay. I'll see you there.
Kelly!
I got you, buddy.
So Jenkins found a legitimate
company owned by Fletcher,
employing one Ray Norris...
Oh, so we finally have a last name.
Any idea what Ray did for him?
No, but maybe we'll find
an answer on that boat.
Judge signed a search warrant this morning.
Mm. So our working theory
is that Fletcher had
something on Gerald Martin.
And you're thinking that
Fletcher was blackmailing him?
Well, he's been arrested
for extortion before.
I mean, it would explain
why Martin might skim money
from Harriet's Hope,
if that's what he was doing.
Yeah, let's say
he was using the foundation
as his personal ATM.
He would've stopped
the minute the I.R.S. showed up.
And if he missed some payment to Fletcher,
someone like Ray
would show up to lean on him.
But Martin fights back,
kills Ray, dumps him in the ocean.
So we might actually
have the ""why.""
If we can figure out
what Fletcher had on him.
Although I'm thinking
it might have something
to do with the class of '85.
You know, I'd really like to take a look
at the yearbook we saw on that boat.
I'll bring it back with me.
Now, uh...
the search warrant for the security footage
at the yacht club.
- We're on it.
- Good.
There. 920.
That's when Bradley
pushed Ray out the door.
Wait. He's going back in.
Let's see when he comes back out.
There's Stacy.
Wait.
- Who's that?
- Helena Percy.
Is she crying?
Well, Payton Bartel did say
that her car was stolen that night.
Wait.
She just went out of frame.
She's back...
seven minutes later.
Maybe she went to look for her car?
Yeah...
A lot of people came out
the front door that night,
but there's no Ray.
I don't think Ray
comes out this door at all.
Bradley and Stacy lied.
Yep.
Looks like someone disconnected
the camera for construction.
If Ray didn't go out the front,
he had to have come out the back.
And so could any number of other people.
We saw Bradley heading back here.
You see what I see?
Those glass blocks.
Maybe...
The head wound
and that splinter of glass...
One of these glass blocks
could be the murder weapon.
That means...
That means this could be our crime scene.
- I'll call my dad.
- Yeah.
That one's missing a tarp.
Dad, you need to send a Forensics team
behind the yacht club.
Okay, my dad's got a team on the way.
What is it?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Drag marks.
Through here.
There's no blood trail.
And don't scalp lacerations
like the one you found on Ray
bleed a lot?
- Copiously.
- Well, that could
explain the missing tarp.
You know, his killer
could've wrapped him in it
and dragged him...
...to the parking lot,
to a vehicle.
Right, 'cause he's got to get
to the ocean somehow.
You grew up here.
If you had a body in your car
and you needed to dump it fast...?
Seems like a pretty public
place to dump a body.
No, it's really desolate at night
and this is the easiest place
to get a body into deep water.
The yacht club's, like, half a mile away,
so this is the first place I thought of.
Looks like someone's driven
up here recently.
We might be able to pick up these tracks.
You know, the way the current flows,
it could carry a body
to where you found Ray.
We need to get a team
down here for a search,
see if anything's washed up on this beach.
- Hello?
- Jeff?
Oh, hi. It's Judy.
Remember, you asked me
to call you if anybody
got on that sailboat in
the slip across from mine...
Well, if you're talking
about the police searching it,
they have a warrant.
No, no, no, they came and went a while ago.
No, I'm talking about
a guy on the deck right now.
I've never seen him before.
He's very suspicious.
Be right there.
We gotta go.
There's nobody here.
Where's Judy?
Judy!
- Judy!
- Hey, Dad.
Yeah.
We're on the boat right now.
No, if someone was here,
they aren't here anymore.
Judy?
Jeff!
Did you see him?
See who?
I don't know. Yeah.
Zee! Call the police!
Jeff!
You hurt?
I'm okay.
Oh! Behind you!
I don't think so.
Oh! He's getting away!
As far as I know,
it's not against the law
for a man to take possession
of his own boat.
There was no sign saying
it was impounded or off-limits.
Your bodyguard tries
to toss my daughter overboard,
and you swung a boat hook at him.
Assault with a deadly weapon
can get you put away for a good long while.
My client saw
what he believed to be
intruders on his property
while searching for spare keys.
He and his security personnel
acted within their legal right
to remove said intruders.
""Security personnel.""
Let's talk about other personnel.
Ray Norris worked for you.
Not as of a week ago.
I fired him.
You typically dismiss employees
with a glass block over the head?
I don't know what you mean.
He was an unreliable deckhand,
neglected to obey orders
in a timely manner.
So I told him to get lost.
Which he did.
In my boat.
You expect us to believe
he stole your boat?
It's not what I expected, I assure you.
Why didn't you report it stolen?
I have a reputation, and I prefer...
You prefer to dish out
retribution yourself?
I prefernot to involve
the police in private matters.
And I'm guessing you consider
your business with Gerald Martin
""a private matter""?
Who's Gerald Martin?
Yes!
Still no sign of Fletcher's bodyguard?
No. Fletcher keeps telling us
he can't reach him,
but we'll round him up soon
if he's still on the island.
And I'll hold Fletcher
on that assault charge for now.
You believe what he said?
Ray Norris stole his boat?
Well, if it's true,
it just made this case a whole lot simpler.
The kid makes off with the boat,
Fletcher chases him down,
and then lives up to his reputation
by killing him.
Okay, if Ray did steal his boat,
he'd know that Fletcher
would come after him hard.
Yeah.
What's the first rule of larceny?
""Don't get caught
with the merchandise.""
So you're saying what,
Ray got himself a room while he was here?
Well, it'd be stupid to stay
on that boat, wouldn't it?
I come bearing evidence.
Oh, yeah?
I found this in Ray Norris's pocket.
The water was trying to turn it to pulp,
but I was able to salvage
some of the larger pieces
and put it together.
""2-1-1-5-9-3.""
It's not a complete number,
but it's better than nothing.
And I've been trying
to figure out what it is.
I thought it was a phone number,
but there's
no ""211"" U.S. area code.
Maybe it's an international number?
You might want to try
a bank routing number.
I've been doing my dad's probate stuff,
filling out a lot of financial documents.
The routing number for his bank
starts with ""21137"".
Maybe there's another bank
with a similar routing number?
Help yourself there.
Okay, let's see here.
No...
Bingo.
So Ray was walking around
with a bank account number in his pocket?
Maybe it's Fletcher's?
Or Gerald Martin's.
Ray had his high school class yearbook.
Where is that, by the way?
It's right here.
Sir? I just spoke
to a hotel manager
who said that Ray Norris
checked in five days ago.
What hotel?
The Pendray.
Anyone talk to him during his stay?
Um, I haven't had the chance
to ask around yet.
And what about housekeeping?
Have they serviced the room
at all this week?
Well, no, because... this.
Ah.
Well, Ray definitely
wasn't sleeping on that boat.
Ugh. Or eating anything close
to a healthy diet.
Remind me never to let you
look in my fridge, Doctor.
Should I go talk to my staff,
see if anyone remembers
talking to this guy?
Good idea.
Jeff...
Look at this.
Helena Percy?
What?
I really couldn't tell you
how that young man
got a hold of my business card.
You're saying you didn't get
any calls from him?
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
You do know
that his cell phone records
will show if he called you.
Well, I could check my voicemail
and see if he left any messages.
That'd be great, Helena.
Only now is not the best time.
Oh.
What's going on, Helena?
It seems the young man that
we read about in the newspaper,
you know, the one that was
killed the night of our gala...
Ray Norris was killed atyour gala,
behind the venue.
Well, it seems
that he had my business card.
Well, my wife's business cards
are all over the island.
She's in charge of fund development.
We want donors to be able to find her.
I was just about to check my voicemail
to see if he'd contacted me.
Payton checks your messages every day,
you'd have known if he'd called.
Helena's only in the office twice a week.
Ah, well, there you go.
Is there anything else
that I can help you with?
Yes, actually.
Can you explain why you were crying
outside the doors of the yacht club,
less than five minutes after
you were smiling up onstage?
I thought it was because of your car,
but you didn't report it stolen
until after midnight.
Well, it's because of all of that.
Dealing with the I.R.S.
We'd just been onstage
bragging about our success,
and in the meantime,
we're dealing with them.
Questions, suspicions...
having to defend our integrity.
Can you blame her
for being a little emotional?
It's contemptible to be accused
of something with no proof.
Helena?
They're asking about the donations
earmarked for the new hospital wing.
Okay.
If you'll excuse us.
- We have to resolve this matter.
- Sure.
She's lying.
How can you be sure?
Well, Ray's cell phone records will tell us
one way or the other.
That's my dad.
He wants us meet him at the South Pier.
Let's go.
All right, boys.
Pull it out.
A tarp was missing
from one of the glass block pallets
behind the yacht club,
and Jeff thought
that it might have been used
to wrap around Ray, to transport the body.
Your murder weapon.
So... I hear you've been
hanging at the police station,
donating your detective skills
to the Chief.
You hear about everything, don't you, Bob?
I must have one of those faces.
People just love to tell me things.
Yeah, well, my, uh, ""skills""
haven't been able to crack the case yet,
and I was hoping I'd find
some answers in here,
but it's a lot of wishing
someone named ""Donna""
a good summer.
Ah, I knew a Donna in high school.
No, wait.
Someone named ""Goose"" said
he loved dancing with her at prom.
Hey, Chief.
Whatcha got?
Just reading the report from Forensics.
They got traces of blood on
that glass block from the tarp.
So no doubt it's the murder weapon?
Yeah, but no prints.
That's too bad.
You know,
if it was freshwater instead of saltwater,
we might've had a shot.
Yeah, they did manage to lift
a couple of partials
off one of those other blocks
that fell off the pallet.
I'm guessing they're gonna be Fletcher's,
or maybe that so-called
""security personnel"" of his.
I'm not so sure that's your best bet.
The simplest story
is always the best bet.
Oh, and listen, uh,
the lab also sent us the model of tires
that made those tracks down at the pier.
If they match the tires on Fletcher's car,
then I think we have our guy.
Would you mind texting me the model?
There's another angle
I want to work on that.
- You got it.
- Thanks.
Bob?
If I was gonna unload a stolen car,
where would I go?
I do know a guy.
You Gus?
You got a sec?
22,075,000, according
to the average life span.
I guess I could spare a few.
Great!
Well, it looks like Vineyard
salvaging is really paying off.
Yeah, metal
is worth its weight in gold these days.
It's a good little side business.
I'm, uh, looking for some parts
for my mother-in-law's car.
She's got high-end tastes
with a low-end budget.
You know what I mean.
What kind of parts are you looking for?
Something that would fit a BMW 7-series.
You got anything like that?
Now, there's a coincidence.
I had one of those come in yesterday.
It's not a coincidence?
Nope.
You want to tell me where you got it?
I got a lot to do today.
Oh, that's fine.
I get it.
I can just call my cop buddy
and have him come down here with a warrant.
Well, now, now, you don't need to do that.
Okay, then.
You tell me where you got it,
and we can forget we ever
had this conversation.
Deal?
Deal.
Yeah.
After you.
Local guy brought it in.
He found it out in the state forest,
thought it was abandoned.
You know... fair salvage.
It wasn't hotwired.
Why are you following me?
You still holding a grudge about that swim?
No. I just wanted
to ask you some questions,
and didn't want the cops involved.
Too late.
Good thing you got a bead
on him when you did.
I've been shadowed by better.
He was trying to stop you finding evidence
that pointed to him and his boss
from Helena Percy's stolen car.
Yeah, well, there's something else
bothering me about that car right now.
It wasn't hotwired.
Whoever stole it had a key.
Aw, man.
Sounds like a party.
Oh, excuse me.
Zee, hi.
Hi, Payton.
What's the occasion?
The I.R.S. just informed us
they finished their investigation,
and found no wrongdoing with our books,
which I always said they would.
Well, that's great.
And we're about to make
Helena's day even better.
Jeff found her car.
Oh, my goodness.
I... I'll go get her.
Helena, Jeff and Zee...
We are very happy to hear
about the car, of course.
It was a minor headache
compared to what we were
dealing with here, though.
Well, you can pick it up tomorrow.
But, unfortunately, we don't
have any keys to give you.
We assume you have a spare set?
Ah, more than one.
She's always misplacing her keys,
so I made several sets for her...
one for her desk, one for her purse,
one for home,
just in case.
So any number of people could
have had access to those keys.
Technically, yes.
See you two on the boat!
All right, Goose.
See you out there.
Cheers.
Did you just call him ""Goose""?
Nickname from high school.
Everyone thinks it's from Top Gun,
but it was from before that,
wasn't it, Tom, because of his laugh?
Right, our Goose is the original.
They should pay him a licensing fee.
Funny.
Well, we'll let you get back to your party.
Let's go, Zee.
Um, thank you.
Thanks.
Cheers.
Jenkins?
Did you find it?
Pulled it up
and printed it out right after you called.
Birth certificate
for ""Raymond Joseph Norris.""
Donna Marie Norris,
Mother.
Father...
Hmm. Unknown.
Okay, so if Gerald Martin
was the ""Goose"" who took Donna to prom...
Ray wanted to meet Gerald Martin
because he believed Martin was his father.
Yeah.
Jeff!
I got some news for you.
We got a match on the prints
we got off the glass block
from the yacht club.
It's not Donovan Fletcher.
Gerald Martin?
No, it's another Martin.
Bradley?
No. It's his sister. Stacy.
Stacy Martin's print
was on one of the glass blocks?
Why would her prints even be in the system?
Little shoplifting incident
a few years ago.
But now we've got her
at the scene of the crime,
handling a block identical
to the murder weapon.
If we're right about Ray's mom,
we have a motive.
Yeah, I'm gonna need you
to explain that one to me.
I didn't put it together at first, either,
but, in high school, the Donna
who owned this yearbook
was named Donna Lawson.
And she has a note in here
from someone named ""Goose""...
That's Gerald Martin's nickname.
Here they are together.
Back up a little bit.
Ray Norris was born in, what, '96?
March 1996, in Concord, New Hampshire.
I know that Martin married
Bradley and Stacey's mom
long before '96.
T-The math just doesn't add up.
Well, when I looked up the class of '85,
I saw an article about a class reunion.
This class's 10-year reunion
would have been in '95.
I'm thinking Martin and Donna
reconnected at the reunion.
She got pregnant, but he was married.
And that's why she put ""father unknown""
on the birth certificate.
But she still his class ring
and, at some point,
she gives it to Ray, tells him the truth.
So he came here to meet his father,
except his other kids
did not like that at all.
Right.
Well...
let's go talk to them.
Chief. What can I do for you?
We need to speak with Stacy.
Bradley, too.
Well, they're not here.
I'm not sure where they went.
Well, you either need to round them up
and bring them down to the station
with your attorney,
or I'll have to put out an APB on them.
This is about
our murder victim, Ray Norris,
the one I saw you
shaking hands with at the gala?
Okay. And?
Well, Ray Norris is the son
of Donna Norris.
Formerly Donna Lawson.
Name ring a bell...
""Goose""?
I went to prom with Donna.
And that was her son?
We were wondering
if it might also have been your son.
You're serious?
Look, I don't think that's possible.
I mean, the last time I saw Donna
was in '89, '90, '91.
You don't seem too sure.
Just find your kids,
call your lawyer,
and meet us at the station, all right?
Zee? What's up?
Um, I came to The Duke
for an early lunch,
and guess who's here?
Bradley and Stacy Martin.
Hey.
Hey, I'm so sorry.
Stacy left
and I just didn't feel
like I could tackle her
on her way out the door.
- Where is he at?
- Over there.
Well, let's see what old Brad has to say.
Not good.
Bradley, wait.
We want to help you.
Look, if you think I'm gonna
tell you where Stacy is,
you can forget it.
Hey. You want to protect her.
I respect that.
Whatever, man.
Look, I think you should know what we know,
at least then
you can make an informed
decision about what to do.
Okay.
What do you know?
Why don't you sit down?
We know Ray believed
he was your father's son.
He thought you were his brother,
and Stacy his sister.
That's why he took you on that boat ride.
It was so ridiculous.
He brought us out
into the middle of the ocean,
he starts telling us
this crazy story about how my dad
got together with his mom
at the high-school reunion.
Did you believe him?
Well, we didn't want to,
but then he shows us this yearbook,
and a ring
he says that my dad gave his mom and...
He had a...
He had a bank account number.
Okay? He called this
his ""real proof.""
He said, that most of his life,
his mom got monthly payments
from our father.
When his mother died,
he found that account number.
And he wanted more money from your dad?
I shouldn't be telling you this...
Ray went to the gala to confront your Dad.
You and Stacy tried to stop him,
but you couldn't get him to leave.
No. Yes, we did.
We did make him leave.
Bradley, there are security
cameras outside the yacht club.
We know he went out with you,
but then he went back in.
And we know Stacy followed him back in,
and went out the back door.
We know this because we found her prints
on one of the glass blocks behind the club.
That is because he pushed her into them.
So you found them together behind the club?
Did you feel like you had to protect her?
I have to go.
Was he about to confess?
What do we do?
We follow him.
Come on.
Thanks.
Those are boat keys.
They must have a boat in that garage.
Stay here.
It's gonna be fine.
Brad, no, don't run!
Bradley!
He didn't do anything!
Hey!
That's not the way out of this, kid.
First of all,
running down my clients like that?
Not the way to win their cooperation.
This is all ridiculous anyways.
Ray Norris is not my son.
I mean, he told my kids that I supposedly
got together with his mother
at our 10-year reunion?
Well, I didn't even go
to my high-school reunion.
I was working in London.
You can check with my boss.
It's not true.
Doesn't matter if it's true or not.
Of course it matters!
I think it kind of matters.
No, what matters
is that these two thought it was true.
You believed him, didn't you?
You believed
he was gonna force his way
into your family.
You believed he was gonna
demand your father's time,
his money...
Things you two were used
to getting all to yourselves.
- It's not true.
- Dut-dut.
Do not answer that.
Not that it matters.
Motive without evidence
is useless in a court of law.
We have Stacy's prints on a glass block.
Not the actual murder weapon.
But that puts her at the scene
the time the murder took place.
And then what?
At 9:53, Bradley Martin
was seen on security footage
from the yacht club,
entering the front door,
and then eyewitness said
that he then
went straight to the coat room.
Where Helena Percy
stated she left her coat,
with the car keys in the pocket.
How would I know that?
I went in there for...
Shh, shh, shh!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
First, you say Stacy's prints
prove she was there,
then Brad going into a coat closet means...
A jury would probably think it means
he helped her get rid of the body.
Maybe even more than that.
Or maybe
he was just defending his sister
during an altercation with Ray.
Is that possible?
If that's the truth of it,
then you could claim self-defense.
But if you want that to fly,
you've got to tell us what happened.
Speculation is not evidence.
You don't have enough
to arrest these two,
let alone convict them.
I think we're done here.
Let's go.
We didn't kill him.
He was alive the last time we saw him.
Okay, Stacy. Let's go.
My dad said
your interview with Brad and Stacy
didn't go so great.
Lawyers are always good at minimizing,
but...
she wasn't wrong.
I mean, we still got
a lot of dots to connect.
I was thinking maybe these kids
wrapped something else in that tarp.
You know, something that could've
washed up somewhere here on this stretch.
Yeah, maybe they slipped
their I.D.s in there.
Or, like, a phone
with the crime recorded on it.
I was thinking a note that said,
""We did it.""
Yeah.
Of course, it would have to be
in tiny little pieces,
so you could have fun
putting it back together.
I don't want to laugh,
it might give you the idea that
I like your sense of humor.
Oh, I wouldn't dare think that.
Not after what you said to me that night
after Wazzy's party out there on the pier.
You told me I was
""sophomoric.""
I had to go home
and look up what that meant.
I mean, of all the things to remember,
you had to remember that.
I can remember other things, too.
Yeah, it was a fun night.
Yeah, it was.
Jackie?
Yeah.
I can do that. Yeah.
I'll see you then.
Jackie Shawl?
She wants to meet in the morning.
Okay.
Well, I've got go check in on a patient,
so good luck
with your needle-in-a-haystack operation.
I'm not saying the I.R.S.
didn't do their due diligence,
but I was certain that the tip I got
about money-skimming
and Harriet's Hope was legit.
How so?
I think Gerald Martin, or someone,
cooked their books
and covered their tracks.
Or your source was wrong.
Could be, but I believed it for a reason.
I think the tip came from Payton Bartel.
The executive director?
What makes you think it was her?
The attention to detail.
I think she tried to get
to the bottom of it herself,
and when she couldn't,
she did a little whistleblowing.
On her own organization?
Well, her father started it,
and she had to hand it over to the Percys.
And the Percys are the ones
who got the big donations...
the office,
the boat they take other donors out on.
And Thomas handed
the financial reins over
to his buddy, Gerald Martin.
Still.
It seems like Payton would be
shooting herself in the foot
to bring attention to the problem.
Not if she got her foundation back.
Yeah...
I know the Percys seem nice,
but I also think that you know
better than anybody
that people are not always what they seem.
Did O'Connor finish
going through Ray's cell phone records?
Did he make any calls to Helena Percy?
No?
We found her business card
in his hotel room.
You know, maybe he called from his room.
Could you check on that and get back to me?
Yes, uh...
""Local doctor Zee Madieras,
daughter of Martha's Vineyard
Chief of Police,
enjoys an afternoon
at the luxurious Pendray Inn.""
Mm-hmm!
Why would you post that?
Okay, if word gets out
that a murder investigation
came through here,
I wanted folks checking us out
to see that important people
still flock here.
Come on!
First of all, this is weeks old,
and, secondly, nobody says I'm important.
And third...
you should have asked.
Okay, you're right.
You're right, I-I should have.
But...
if the number
of social media ""likes"" count,
you are important.
No!
Okay, look.
Look how many ""likes"" on
this picture of us at the gala.
Well, yeah, we look fabulous.
Mm-hmm. Ooh...
Did you see this one?
You and the handsome detective.
Wait a second...
That looks like Ray Norris.
Yeah, it is.
That's... That's our victim.
Yeah, I remember seeing him at the gala.
He was talking to Helena Percy.
Right after she came off the stage.
What?
What...
I'm so sorry, I have to go.
So, look, this is...
right after the speeches,
and there's Ray.
- And Britt posted this?
- Mm-hmm.
What's that hashtag she's using?
Um, ""Harriet's Hope Gala.""
Well, see if there's any other
photos using that same hashtag.
Yes!
Bingo.
Look who Ray's walking towards,
when he comes back in...
that's Thomas Percy.
And Britt told me she saw him
talking to Helena.
Keep going.
Wait. Right... Right there.
Yeah.
Play that video.
...Be merry.
And dance!
Yes, please dance.
As long as you don't have
two left feet like me.
You know, someone once said to me...
""To love
and be loved
is everything.""
So thank you, everyone,
for showing us your love
and allowing us to spread it
far and wide...
- Where are you going?
- Come on.
You know how, in yearbooks,
they had everyone pick a quote
and print it under their photo?
Look at Donna Lawson's.
""To love and be loved is everything.""
Thomas Percy used Donna's
favorite quote in his speech.
That's what turned Ray around.
H-He was probably thinking
the same thing I'm thinking right now...
that Thomas, not Gerald, was his father.
So he's the one who reconnected with Donna
at the 10-year reunion
for some one-night fling?
Well, he was quoting her about love.
He was sending money,
even after the kid was grown...
I'd say it was more than one night,
which makes it even more difficult to hide.
You mean from Helena.
He called her.
Ray, that is,
three hours before
he showed up at the gala,
from his hotel room.
She said he didn't,
but the Pendray has a PBX phone system
that tracks calls.
Helena lied.
And Ray was talking to her.
Right before he got killed.
Come on.
Where is everybody?
Hello?
Oh!
You scared me.
You're back.
We're here to talk to Helena Percy.
Or Thomas,
if either of them are available.
No, I'm sorry,
they gave the staff the day off.
I'm just here putting
some files back in storage.
Is there something I can help you with?
Actually, there is.
Um, my dad hasn't made any arrests
in the murder of Ray Norris...
Oh, I thought your dad
had someone in custody.
Someone named Fletcher?
Well, we haven't ruled him out,
but we've come across
some photos of the victim
attempting to talk to Thomas
the night of the gala.
Talk to Thomas?
Why would he do that?
That's a good question.
You have any guesses?
He also called Helena just before the gala.
Did she happen to mention that to you?
Uh...
No.
No, I don't think so.
Well, Percy told us
that you pick up
Helena's messages sometimes.
Did you pick up her messages
the day of the gala?
Yeah, I may have.
There was someone who called,
wanting to know if he needed
a ticket to get into the gala.
Was it Ray Norris?
I really don't remember.
And did you pass that message on to Helena?
Or did you delete it?
What?
Payton...
you know exactly
who Ray Norris is, don't you?
I don't know what you mean.
And you know that Thomas
was having an affair
with Ray's mother.
And that he was supporting a child.
You know what?
I think I hear someone right now.
Maybe it's them.
I'll go check.
Why are you talking to her like that?
Because she's in it up to her neck.
[
Her office is down this way.
Payton.
Payton, wait!
You just need to answer a few questions.
- Whoa!
- Stop right there
or I'll shoot her, I swear.
- Payton...
- You should've just
let me walk out.
Payton, you don't need to do this!
Zee, look at me.
It's gonna be okay.
She doesn't want to hurt you.
Do you, Payton?
- I never wanted to hurt anyone.
- I know.
You were just trying to protect
the foundation
that bears your mother's name.
Get back.
Get back to the conference room!
And that's why you made a pact
with Thomas Percy, isn't it?
He raised money for you,
and you turned a blind eye while he...
What? Set up
a phony vendor number
so he could send money to Ray's mother?
Get back!
But you had it under control.
You and Percy figured out
a way to cover your tracks.
It was all gonna blow over.
Until Ray showed up at that gala.
Ray Norris,
who was there to demand
his father pony up more money.
I'm sorry.
This is a private party.
Oh, really?
My name's Ray Norris.
That man, Tom Percy,
is my biological father.
Maybe he told you what he wanted.
Maybe you convinced him you wanted to help.
Thomas...
Told him, if he stayed out back,
you'd send Percy out to meet him.
And that's when Stacy Martin found him.
You are embarrassing your...
They argued,
and then her brother showed up...
Stacy!
...And tried
to make Ray leave.
Hey! Hey, no. Forget it!
It's fine, let's go.
This isn't over, Ray.
And that's when you confronted him.
Mr. Norris?
I spoke to Mr. Percy.
He has no clue what you're talking about.
What if I told you I had proof?
But we know
he had an account number in his pocket.
Zero-two-one-one-
three-five-nine-eight-
seven-zero.
Does that account number
ring any bells to you?
It was a Harriet's Hope
account number, wasn't it?
It was a number
that would have destroyed everything
that you and your family
worked so hard to build.
What choice did you have...
...But to kill him?
Stop!
Jeff!
Jeff!
Jeff!
Kelly!
Zee!
Get on board.
Move it!
Okay, just don't shoot.
Sit down and don't move.
Get up the stairs. Now!
Zee!
Take it easy!
Payton!
Payton...
Ah!
Jeff! Watch out!
Drop it!
You okay?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Any news on the board re-electing you?
None yet.
But if they do, it'll be thanks to you.
Well, if you're passing around credit...
You should probably pass some
to your daughter.
Oh! He always makes me
feel appreciated.
You ready?
Mm.
Just so you know,
this house call's a one-time deal.
Cortisone is not the best
solution to your problem.
You have a better solution
you want to offer?
How about not trying to make
a long jump record onto a boat?
Even if it was pretty dazzling.
You know, you're allowed
to tell me you were impressed.
Oh.
You gonna tell me
how this bullet got there?
Maybe.
Someday.
And, yes, you do
have to catch your own dinner.
Uh, I'm from the Vineyard.
I'll catch mine and I'll catch yours.
- Oh!
- Yeah!
You're something else, you know that?
Let's see what you got.
How do you think it's going to go?
How I'm going to do?
I think you're gonna get skunked.
You think you're gonna catch something?
Are you kidding me?
It's all in the wrist.
- Look at these style points.
- What style points?
Side-arm, one-handed..."
16,A Beautiful Planet (2016) - full transcript,An exploration of Earth and beyond as seen from the International Space Station. Narrated by Jennifer Lawrence.,"logo whooshing
slow, dreamy music
spooky haunting music
- Narrator Our
Milky Way is just one
among billions of
galaxies in the universe.
In every way, an
ordinary galaxy.
It's 100,000 light years across.
There are hundreds of
billions of stars here.
Almost lost inside
this huge swarm
is one average sized star.
As stars go, it's
quite unremarkable.
Nevertheless, it's
the most special place
in all the cosmos.
Orbiting this star is
the only place we know
in all the universe
to harbor life.
Our beautiful planet
is a world of water,
sparkling blue in the
light of our star.
Two thirds of it is ocean.
Gossamer clouds drift above it,
driven by ocean currents.
All of it is wrapped in
a delicate cocoon of air
that shields us from
our star's radiation.
Three brave explorers
are about to leave
the safety of Earth.
They are an American,
Terry Virts,
a Russian, Anton Shkaplerov,
and an Italian,
Samantha Christoferetti.
Their mission: six months in
space to study microgravity,
do biomedical research,
and observe the Earth.
They're sealed inside
this tiny metal cocoon,
a Russian Soyuz
spacecraft traveling
at 17,500 miles an hour.
Their destination?
The International Space Station.
It was built in orbit
by 16 countries.
It's a research lab,
training facility,
and observatory,
all powered by the sun.
A truly awesome example
of what we can achieve
when we work together.

- Butch Hey hey, you're
hung up in the cord.
- Narrator Already on board
to welcome the new arrivals,
Russian crew members
Sasha Samokutaev
and Yelena Serova.
astronauts chattering faintly
- Samantha The arrival
to the Space Station
was possibly the happiest
moment of my life, really.
And then they were,
Yelena, Sasha, and Butch
welcome us on board and it
was just sheer happiness.
We hugged, really I was
like a child at that point,
I mean, it's something I
had dreamed of for years,
I'd studied the Space Station,
I'd worked so hard to get
there and finally I was there.
- Astronaut Come on man.
- Astronaut I heard
you bagging all that.
- Hi, Mom.
- Narrator Terry is welcomed
by Commander Butch Wilmore.
- Terry Great launch.
You know it was a
pretty wild ride.
- Narrator Butch
describes the crazy scene.
- Butch As I
watched Anton, I mean,
he was thrilled and doing flips,
and excited, floating
around hitting the ceiling.
shouting indiscernibly
Samantha, the look on her face,
just absolutely thrilling,
it was literally
electric in the room,
it was fabulous.
- Narrator Samantha
recalls her first ever
view from space.
- Samantha But I just
couldn't resist take a peek
and I could just see
the Earth majestically
flowing by and it
was like a river.
And you know, I don't
know what happiness is,
but I was definitely
happy at that time.
- Narrator The cupella
is a magical window
unlike any other on the
spectacle of our Earth
and ourselves, past,
present and future.
- Samantha What I always
found especially moving
were the passes where we
would fly from the Atlantic
and then fly over Gibraltar
onto the Mediterranean
and it was almost like
I was doing this journey
that travelers from myths
and legends and the past
had dreamt off or performed
in the reverse way
right from the Mediterannean,
through Gibraltar,
which once was considered
the end of the known world.
- Narrator More
than 500 years ago
explorers rounded the
stormy tip of South Africa.
As an omen for future
trade, they named it
the Cape of Good Hope.
At the same time, the
glorious Caribbean beckoned
with the untold riches
of the new world.
Aboriginal people came from
Asia more than 30,000 years ago
bringing their spiritual
ties to this land,
the continent we now
know as Australia.
The Mauri people from Polynesia
traveled thousands of
miles in tiny canoes
across the Pacific Ocean before
they reached New Zealand.
Home to the ancient
Inca civilization
the longest mountain range
in the world, The Andies.
They stretch 45,000 miles
across some of the most
extreme climate zones on Earth,
from ice fields to deserts.
The oldest and driest desert
is the Namib in Africa.
You can see our
climates from space,
the great lakes of North America
lie trapped in ice and snow
for more than a
third of the year.
You can also see evidence
of Earths violent past.
Asteroid impacts have left
scars on it's surface.
This crater in Quebec
is 62 miles across.
The Earth is still active,
volcanoes tear
through it's surface,
the Comchakka peninsular in
Russia has over 100 of them.
Now Terry Birds
describes his experience.
- Terry One of the
most beautiful things
to see from space is
thunder storms at night.
And there's certain
parts of the Earth,
Central Africa especially,
but also South East Asia,
there are just amazing
amounts of thunder storms.
You see thousands of
flashes per minute.
Unbelieveable amount of
power, when you think about
a giant lightning bolt
going off near your house
and how loud it is,
and how that scares you
and the dog runs
under the table,
well when you see it from
space there's so many
of these things happening
at the same time,
it's truly amazing.
- Male You see power, a
funnel 25 miles in diameter
of the center of a
hurricane or a typhoon
and you go oh my.
- Terry Typhoon
Mysac was amazing,
I've never seen
anything like that,
the eye was so big,
so well defined.
- Male That you realize
that that's energy
and it power, powerful energy.
- Narrator Far above the
storm, every drop of water
is carefully rationed.
- Terry There's
no showers in space,
so there's no, you can't
just go under the water
and let it run, it's
just kind of wet towels
and wiping down, but
you can get pretty clean
and washing your
hair is not too bed.
- Female In principle we
want to recycle all the water
which means that the
urine gets recycled,
but also your sweat, all
the humidity from the air
which is accuperated
into the system
via the air conditioning
system also gets recycled
into portable water.
It's not 100% efficient system,
so we do have water bags on
the space station as well.
- Narrator The Space X
resupply ship called Dragon
arrives from Florida.
It's one of the first commercial
craft to bring up supplies.
- Male It brings food
and water and equipment,
and without that we
wouldn't be able to live
more then a few extra
months on the space station.
But on Earth we kind of
don't have any supply ships,
it's almost like
a mission to Mars
when you're not gonna
get a supply ship
you have to pack
everything with you.
- Male When we're all
doing cargo ops together,
I mean it is organized
bedlam, literally,
criss crossing, people
flying, packages flying,
going here and there,
and you have to get them
in the right place,
you can't put it
in the wrong spot
because you'll lose it.
You won't be able to find it
because there's so much,
literally thousands of items
and you can't remember
where you put every single
one of them.
That's why we have to
have this database.
We lost a 14 inch torque wrench
and it was gone for five weeks,
and just floated off I guess,
and went into some
little nook and cranny
somewhere, hid itself, and it
finally reappeared one day.
tranquil music
- Woman I like
to sleep floating.
So I did not attach my sleeping
bag to the walls at all,
and especially at the
beginning, I would just like,
close my eyes and
let myself float,
and just fall asleep.
- Narrator Butch and Terry
are getting ready
for a space walk.
There are a lot
of complex systems
on the outside of the station,
and sometimes, they need fixing.
- Woman If you wanna
go outside of course
you have to survive
in outer space.
This suit allows you to do that.
So Butch really
fills out the suit,
but it also means when you're
trying to put the suit on
or take it off, it's
quite some work.
- Butch Getting
out of the hatch is
an entire operation
in and of itself.
We have so much equipment on us.
Your backpack tends to
bang into the hatch,
or your helmet wants
to bang into the hatch.
You walk around by grabbing
onto things with your gloves,
almost 300 degrees on the sun
side of the space station.
You get in the shade,
it's minus 275 degrees.
You feel that inside the suit.
My fingertips in the sunlight,
like, I could feel
them on fire almost,
from the fatigue a little
bit but also from the heat
coming through on that
sun side of the orbit.
So you know, I'd curl
my fingers at times
and put them in the
shade a little bit
and let them cool down.
- Astronaut Okay
Butch, we'll take them.
- Butch You can lose where
you are on the station.
So you're always thinking
you have a safety tether
attached to the station.
It's on a reel, like a
fishing reel type thing
with a spring that
always reels it in.
You can be upside down,
twisted, inverted,
and completely lose
your spatial awareness
about where you are and
what your attitude is,
and you can easily get tangled
up in that safety tether
if you're not cautious.
Every single movement you make,
you're making an effort
to think through it.
- Man The outside
of the space station
is not just a sidewalk.
It's a jungle of
wires and equipment
and metal bars and tresses.
Well, if you accidentally
sliced your glove,
or your space suit on
one of those sharp edges,
that could create a leak,
and if that leak were big
enough, you would die.
- Man The hardest thing
during a space walk, for me,
is getting out of the hut.
- Woman The only way that
we found to actually get
Butch to come out of the
upper torso of the hut
was for me to basically, push
and shake, and push and shake,
until he finally was able to
free himself from the suit.
groaning
laughing
- There we go.
christmas music
- Man Holidays in
space were great,
but to be honest, I missed home.
Of course we didn't wanna
leave Santa hanging.
If there's somebody that
you don't wanna make mad,
it's Santa Clause,
so we put the milk and
cookies in the airlock.
We weren't sure exactly how
he would get in
the space station,
but we assumed the
airlock would be
kind of our equivalent
of a chimney.
So we thought that
would be a good place
to leave the milk and cookies.
laughing
- Wow.
- Hey!
- Wow.
- For you.
- Nice.
- For your haircut?
- That is cool.
- I think this is
a secret message
that I need to cut my hair.
laughing
- Man I speak three languages.
I speak English,
Russian, and Tennessee.
As you're learning Russian,
they say the first 10
years is the hardest.
That's a fact!
And then all of a sudden,
the day arrives, boom!
And it's time to go home.
- Narrator The
Soyuz spacecraft is
ready to take Butch,
Sasha, and Yolana home.
- Man And of course,
you're looking forward,
you're coming home,
your wife, your family,
you've been away from
them for eight months.
- Derek's man to man time,
make us proud.
- Man But of course,
the people that you're
leaving behind too,
you spent six months with them,
and it's a very
melancholy feeling,
because the hatch shuts,
and they're gone,
and you realize that part
of your life is over,
and you're not gonna
have this same fellowship
with those people ever again,
and it is a sad feeling.
- See you bud.

- Man In space, without
gravity pulling you down,
you grow, and I grew
almost two inches.
Unfortunately the minute
I got back to Earth,
I lost those.
- Narrator In zero G,
without the loading of gravity,
your bones and muscles
will weaken very quickly.
To stay in shape is
extremely important
for the crews to
exercise, a lot.
Jâ Baby break a sweat Jâ
Jâ Break a sweat Jâ
Jâ Baby break a sweat Jâ
- Woman Well, we have two
and a half hours of exercise
scheduled every day,
and that includes cardio,
and this marvelous machine,
which is called ARID,
and you can do things like,
squats and dead lifts,
and shoulder presses.
- Man 80 this is a great
example of no three being busy.
I'm working on the bathroom,
and there's a lot of plumbing,
and valves, and systems
that I was changing,
all while Samantha's exercising.
It's a busy place,
but it's important to keep
this equipment working.
Jâ Baby break a sweat Jâ
- Alright, Samantha.
I'm gonna put the
final clip in here.
- Samantha I kept joking that
he wouldn't be
qualified for his flight
unless he came with
me to my hair dresser
to learn how to cut my hair.
- Of all the things
we do as astronauts,
this scares me the most.
- Narrator For the crews
that live on the station,
one of the most
important things of all
is being able to
see, from day to day
what we here on the ground
can't see so clearly.
What is happening to our Earth,
and how we are changing it.
We began with a home
of lush, green forests,
animals, and plants.
With more and more
of us to feed,
we began clearly
the land for farms,
but when you cut down the trees,
there are other losses too.
Great forests once covered much
of the island of Madagascar.
You can see how many
of them are gone.
Without tree roots to anchor it,
the red soil oozes down
hill, clogging the rivers,
and vanishing into the sea.
Unique animals, like the
lemurs are losing their homes.
The great rainforest in
Brazil continues to disappear.
It's home to nearly half
the species found on Earth.
In just four decades,
almost half a
million square miles
have been cut down and burned.
From space you can
see huge smoke plumes
stretching across the rainforest
for hundreds of miles.
Thousands of species up
in smoke, forever lost.
As the forests burn,
carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gasses
spew into our atmosphere.
We've always taken our
fresh air for granted,
but we know now that
the fossil fuels we burn
also release clouds of pollution
into the air we breathe.
They fill the
atmosphere with gasses
that cause the
climate to change.
As a result, the Earth's
temperature is rising.
In California,
it's affecting our most precious
resource on Earth, water.
- Man Seeing California
is beautiful from space.
It actually looks like a
giant ice cream scooper
went right down the
middle part of the state
and scooped out
the central valley,
but it's very brown,
and you could really tell
there's a drought going on,
and that they could
probably use a lot of rain.
- Narrator In efforts
to save parched crops
we used ground water.
So much of it in
the last 75 years,
that parts of the valley
have sunk 30 feet.
- Man The life of
ranchers and farmers
depend on water rights,
and who can take what water
out of which river.
Even cities like San Diego,
Las Angeles, and Phoenix
depend completely on
their access to water.
- Narrator The
Colorado river basin
supplies water to 40 million
of us in seven states.
The reservoirs that
make the system work
are losing water
at alarming rates.
They need huge amounts of
runoff from snow to feed them,
and the runoff has
dwindled in recent years.
California's reservoirs
could soon be dry.
- Man I had never seen
the Himalayas at all,
and the immense size was
just, it was mind boggling.
They just went on for hundreds
and hundreds of miles.
- Narrator In the
shadow of Mount Everest,
several of the Earth's great
rivers begin their journey
across the Indian subcontinent.
They provide water to
drink, irrigation for crops,
a place for worship,
but now the rising temperatures
are causing glaciers and snow,
high on the plateau, to melt.
The water supply of
over 500 million people
is now threatened.
By the time the river has
reached the Ganges Delta,
they've become pipelines
for all kinds of pollution,
pouring into the sea,
but problems like
this can be solved,
and when we work at it,
sometimes we succeed.
- Man When I was
a kid in the 705,
the Chesapeake Bay was a mess,
and the fish, and the
crabs were disappearing,
and there was a big restriction.
You couldn't fish for rock fish,
and other types of fish.
It's been cleaned up,
and in a few decades time,
it's a beautiful place now.
It's thriving.
That's a great success
story of conservation.
It's a giant universe out there,
but there's nowhere like Earth.
It's a beautiful planet.
We have air that we can breathe,
we have water that we can drink.
Food is there for us.
We have this life support
system that's like,
perfectly designed to
support billions of humans
and it's pretty amazing
to see how much effort
we had to put into designing
and building the space station.
- Narrator But what
if our surface water
disappeared all together?
This actually happened on
our neighboring planet, Mars.
Unlike Earth, Mars doesn't
have a magnetic field.
Without any protection,
its atmosphere was ripped
away from the planet
by the solar wind.
If you could stand on Mars today
you would find a landscape
of lifeless desolation.
Very cold and very dry.
But on Earth things are going
in a very different direction.
Ice and snow are melting at
rates we've never seen before.
In Greenland, time-lapse cameras
captured a 23 square mile chunk
of the Yakov Slavin
glacier breaking off.
The Greenland ice
sheet is melting.
If the whole ice
sheet were to melt
sea levels could rise 20 feet.
As the level rises, low lying
coastal areas will submerge.
The city of New
Orleans could be gone,
but we could change
this if we step up
to limit the greenhouse
gasses we're producing.
- Samantha As human beings
we need to start to consider
ourselves more and more as
crew members of this Earth,
not passenger, you know?
Nobody gets a free ride.
You have a responsibility
to take care of your
fellow crew mates.
Just like we do on
the space station.
It's more difficult to do it
when you're talking
about billions of people,
but that's really the mindset
that we have to work towards.
crew chattering
and celebrating
- Narrator A new crew has
arrived at the stations.
Two Russians, Gennady Padalka
and Mikhail Korniyenko,
and an American, Scott Kelly.
The mission for both
Scott and Mikhail,
is to spend a full year here
so researchers can study
how they're affected
by long-term space travel.
Scott is soon providing
data for his study.
- Woman One of the
more recent discoveries
in terms of the effects
of weightlessness
on human physiology
is the effect that
it had on our eyes.
Several long deration
crew members in the past
have reported the worsening
of their eyesight,
while they were up in space.
- Next one.
That was what we needed Scott.
Let's move on to the review.
- I have an espresso, it's
a space espresso machine,
which was developed in Italy,
and we actually,
for the first time,
could enjoy a good
espresso in space.
It's a welcomed change.
I'm actually gonna try
and drink it out of this
zero G cup.
Let's see what happens.
Very much an experiment,
but it will be a lot nicer
if I get to drink my espresso
from an actual cup,
instead of from a pouch.
Let's see.
smooth easygoing music
Wow, that was good.
That was real good.
- Narrator Six
months have passed,
and it's time for Terry,
Samantha, and Anton
to say their goodbyes.
It's a bittersweet departure.
- See you on Earth.
- Narrator Three new
crew members have moved in.
They've set about
a special project,
which will be very important
when people take longer
journeys to other planets.
The best results are
produced in this pink light.
Without soil, the
crew is attempting
to grow their own crops.
Kjell Lindgren, an
American medical doctor,
inspects the progress.
- Kjell Vege was an
amazing experiment,
to grow this plant in space
but we also got to eat it.
- Narrator Kjell's crewmate,
Kimiya Yui, is from Japan.
- Kjell Well I know that
I enjoyed the lettuce.
I think Kimiya is not a
big fan of vegetables.
His father is actually
a lettuce farmer.
So I think he's had
a lot of lettuce.
- Narrator Happily, fresh
food is about to arrive,
this time on the Japanese
HTV resupply ship.
- Man The HTV
maneuver is complete.
- Kimiya It's like
a golden treasure box.
- Kjell A golden treasure box?

You'll have to share your

- Narrator We are
approaching England,
and its great capital, London.
Across the English Channel
to right is France,
and the Glorious city of Paris.
Europe lies beyond.
- Man During the daytime,
it's kind of hard to tell
that people are on Earth.
You don't see that much
evidence of humanity.
- Narrator But at night,
the same view tells
a different story.
It's easy to see how populated
our planet really is,
and how many of us have
gathered in towns and cities.
Now you can spot famous cities
like Amsterdam, Brussels,
the capital of Russia, Moscow,
the vibrant cities of Japan,
Osaka, Nagoya, and Tokyo,
Beloved Rome, and Naples.
- Woman Italy at
night is very modern
because it's incredibly bright.
It's a densely populated
country of course,
so you really see
all the cities,
and you have this
very distinct shape
that you can very definitely
see at night as well,
of this boot,
reaching into the darkness
of the Mediterranean.
It is just
overwhelmingly beautiful.
- Narrator The undulating
ribbon of light is Nile River,
illuminated by people drawn
from the desert to its water.
Cairo gleams like a jewel
in the Delta's crown.
To the left, Israel,
and the cities of Tel
Aviv and Jerusalem.
- Man I think one of
the most amazing sights
I saw with my eye
was coming across the southern
United States, Florida,
into the Caribbean sea,
through the Bahamas at night,
with a full moon,
and you could see the aqua
colors in the Bahama area,
all the way down through Cuba,
and then the Dominican
Republic, Haiti,
on into Puerto Rico,
and then the Virgin
Islands beyond that.
Oh my goodness.
- Man Fishing boats
really stand out at night,
especially in Asia,
and the Animen Sea,
and near Thailand, there's a
bunch of green fishing boats.
During the day you can't tell
there's people in the ocean
down there, but at night time,
there's lots of folks fishing.
You can see that.
- Man I can see
where I was born,
Murphy's Burrow looks like a
little diamond below Nashville.
North of that, Louisville,
of course Indianapolis
just beyond there.
Pittsburgh, and then
looking to the left
you can see the great lakes,
and of course the cities
of Green Bay, Chicago,
you can see Cleveland
evident, Buffalo,
and then further
up the east coast,
coming to Richmond, Washington,
Baltimore, Philadelphia,
New York, Long
Island sticks out,
just absolutely gorgeous.
Boston, Cape Cod, very visible,
just absolutely beautiful,
and then of course the
cities across the border,
Toronto, Ottawa,
Montreal, Quebec City.
- Narrator Astronauts
often remark that
you don't see any national
borders from space,
but there are exceptions.
The strand of orange
light dividing the view
is the border separating
Pakistan from India.
- Man I wish that there
weren't issues, but there are.
We have different ideals,
and different mindsets,
and it causes us
to have the border.
- Narrator The most
noticeable border at night
is between North
and South Korea.
- Man Seoul, South Korea
is one of the brightest,
most vibrant cities
on the planet.
The whole South Korean
country is lit up,
and then there's this
line in the border,
and this complete
darkness of North Korea,
with a few little white
lights where Pyongyang is,
but there's a similar
number of people
on both sides of the border,
and you can really
see the difference
between how people live.
- Narrator By moonlight,
the Gulf of Mexico
and the great cities of Dallas,
Houston, and San Antonio.
The landscape around
them is ablaze
with thousands of
oil and gas flares.
To meet our ever-increasing
energy needs for the future,
we'll have to develop
new energy sources
on a far larger scale,
and one of them is our own sun.
As the space station
crosses its face,
from 250 miles below,
you can see the solar panels
that provide its power.
Here on Earth, we must go
beyond capturing the sun's rays
and learn how to create
energy the way the sun does,
by nuclear fusion.
The challenge is to
build a fusion reactor
that will provide enough
power for all our needs.
If you can figure out
how to reproduce this
you can create immense
amounts of power
and leave no pollution.
Our sun also bombards us
with lethal radiation.
Without protection, most living
creatures cannot survive it,
but our Earth has
a magnetic field
which deflects the harmful
particles away from us.
The aurora shows that
shield in action.
mystical captivating music
Because we have this magical
magnetic field protecting us,
we have our forests,
oceans, animals, and people.
It's why ours is
a planet of life.

- Woman What struck me
looking at Earth from space
is the fact that you can
really perceive it visually
as a spacecraft.
I've heard before about
you know, spaceship Earth,
but when you are up there,
you really cannot
escape that notion.
It's totally obvious that
it is a celestial body
that is carrying all of us,
all of humanity,
all of life on Earth on
this journey through space,
and just like the space
station is, you know,
a human made outpost there
that allows us to survive
in this hostile
environment of space,
well, you know, our Earth
does the same for all of us.
I can imagine of course
a future in which
human beings are able to
travel to other star systems.
So I really hope
that at some point
there will be a breakthrough
in science and technology
that will allow us to
travel faster than light
and actually explore
different star systems.
- Narrator Don't
you wonder sometimes?
Are there planets
around other stars?
Could they have life?
Though, we can't yet travel
to the stars ourselves,
our telescopes can.
Astronomers have
already discovered
several thousand planets.
We're searching around stars
for the perfect conditions,
not too hot, not too cold,
for liquid water to exist.
We call this the
Goldilocks zone.
We can detect a planet as it
crosses in front of a star,
blocking its light.
This is one system
we found, Kepler 186.
It's 500 light years from Earth,
and it contains a remarkable
five Earth sized planets.
Most important of all, the
outermost planet, Kepler 186F
is just the right distance
from its star for water,
and life to exist.
Could this be another Earth?
- Woman In the end,
it's about two things.
It's about this great
adventure of exploring,
and then it's about
how our world works,
and expanding the possibilities
of what we human beings can do.
- Narrator And we can
do great things together.
If we all do our part,
for our children,
and great grandchildren,
our Earth will always be
a beautiful planet.

A BEAUTIFUL SECRET
Jorge!
Time to get up!
Get up.
It's 6:50, time for your bath.
Good morning, Willy.
You got up early.
You woke me up.
Whatever.
Freaking mosquitoes.
They bit me all over,
sons of bitches.
Jorge, are you up yet?
You have to hurry up...
- Jorge!
- Mom!
Gross.
Why is this so thick, Mom?
Don't act like that.
I made it with love.
I used 3 eggs, you need to
have your strength.
Three?
Why so many?
I told you I have a late meeting
and I want you to eat well.
Mom, I would've preferred
to make my own breakfast...
than to eat this sh...
puke.
Don't be rude.
Besides you and I need to talk...
about what you were doing
in front of the mirror.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
I'm having breakfast.
And you?
That's good.
Yes.
Yes...
He's right here.
I'll call you later.
Exactly.
Yes.
Okay.
Take care, bye.
Finished?
Who were you talking to so discreetly?
No...
Discreet? You think?
No.
Who was it?
It was the boss.
He wants me to make some photocopies,
so early in the morning.
It's always the same.
Do you know where I can make them?
What? You liked it?
No, I still suck my thumb, Mom.
Ma, aren't you leaving
earlier than usual?
Yes, honey.
And I won't be able
to take you to school.
Again?
I have to go ask Marcela
something about work.
Didn't you have to go make
some copies?
Well, yes. That and then I'm
going with Marcela.
Here comes a taxi.
I'm glad it's available.
OK, honey, take care.
And don't eat any junk food.
With what money?
Oh, yes. You're right.
I don't have a lot change but...
just so you know what a good
mother I am... here...
Take it all. There you are.
Be a good boy. Take care.
Mom, don't treat me like a baby.
Anyway, I'll call you in the afternoon
to make sure you're all right.
Mom, when have you ever called me?
Bye. Be a good boy, darling.
Bye.
He' s got the ball...
he takes hold of it slowly.
Slowly, he fools everybody
and kicks it long.
It's half way there,
it crosses and...
Hey, you.
Asshole! You scared me!
- Leave my things alone.
- What's your problem?
- Why are you so scared?
- You scared me, asshole!
I didn't know you were going
to come by here.
Oh, look, crayons...
- Moron.
- What's your problem?
Why do you come this way
if it scares you?
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not. I only do that with your mother.
I've been following you.
And I saw how you almost
peed in your pants.
Why were you following me?
I know, you like my ass...
- I know it's tight.
- Yeah, right... tight ass, please.
Nuts!
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
GABRIELA MISTRAL
Jorge del Pino.
Please stand up.
Yes, teacher.
Did you study your Spanish lesson
you had for homework?
Yes... yes.
Good, what was it about?
Well... we had to look up poems...
written by Alfonso Reyes.
Very good, very good.
And which poems did you study?
The poems that I studied...
were simple, short...
really short poems, one of them...
Jorge!
There's only one thing
I'd like you to tell me.
Yes?
Did you study?
Yes or no?
No.
That's all I needed to know.
""Persons"" like you
don't get far in life.
Because of ""persons"" like you,
Mexico is how it is.
Because of ""persons"" like you...
crises and social injustices
are drowning us completely.
Because of ""persons"" like you,
we have clumsy and mediocre people...
damaging our country.
How can they not be mediocre...
if they don't even know
the kind of Mexico we had?
Anyway, it's unbelievable
that at your age...
you don't even know who the big
authors of our country are.
All this and you're repeating
the school year.
Or do you know?
- No.
- No, what?
No, Miss Conchita.
Do you know who
Gabriela Mistral was?
No.
- Or Amado Nervo, perhaps?
- No.
Do you even know who
Jose Vasconcelos was?
No.
Perhaps you know
what Sir Vasconcelos...
did for our culture
and the knowledge...
of the universal literature
in our country?
No.
Do you even know who
Julio Cortazar was?
- No.
- Diego Rivera?
- No.
- Frida Kahlo?
No.
Do you know who Emilio Carballido,
Jose Luis Cuevas...
Gabriel Garcia Marquez,
Agustin Lara, Gabilondo Soler?
Do you know who
Flat-Nose Linares is?
Who?
Who did you say?
Flat-Nose Linares?
So who is this
Flat-Nose Linares?
Flat-Nose Linares is the guy that
fucks your husband in the ass...
because your husband is a fag.
This time you really did it.
How could you have said that
the teacher's husband is gay?
You're going to flunk.
- Like I care.
- Don't be stupid.
If they expel you now, you might
have to repeat the school year.
Remember there's only 2 months
left for school to finish.
I don't care. Nobody talks to me
that way, not even my mother.
Why did you have to answer so badly?
Yeah.
But she really crossed the line.
Why did she start giving
names of people...
I don't give a damn about,
like Vasconcelos?
Who gives a shit
who Vasconcelos was?
That's why they flunked you.
Nobody can talk to you.
I'm leaving, you really stink.
- You should smell yourself.
- Go to hell.
Anyway, I might pass by your house
later if we decide to play soccer.
OK.
See you.
Bye.
Mom, I'm home.
Mom?
Mom?
I'm coming.
Hurry up.
Hold on, asshole.
Careful, don't speak that way
to your daddy.
I'm terrified.
- Goofing off?
- So?
What?
Ready to play?
You're going to play?
Yes, hurry up.
David and Fran are waiting.
So, where are we playing?
What's up? Ready?
Guys...
Why didn't you find
somewhere else to play?
Come on, don't be a baby.
Or are you scared of the house?
Didn't you say it was haunted?
Yes, but from the inside
not the outside.
Jorge, are you on Beto's team?
I'm with you.
Only bitches on that team.
Throw it.
Over here.
Here Jorge.
You're such an asshole.
How could you kick it in the house?
- You're crazy.
- Why don't you go get it.
- No way.
- You bunch of idiots.
Kick his ass, kick his ass,
kick his ass.
Now who's going to get the ball?
I don't know but I'm not going.
That house is haunted.
I'm not going.
- Fat-ass, should go.
- Then go for it!
No way. I'm not going.
Shut up!
Let's see who's it!
Even or odds, even or odds.
No, let's do it again!
Go up the wall
or are you a pussy?
Hurry up, man!
Listen,
how do I get in?
Climb up the wall!
Hurry up!
Dumb ass!
What are you doing here?
Jorge!
Get out of here, you stupid kid!
Get out of my house!
And I never want to see you again!
Oh, shit.
Hurry up! Jump!
Incredible.
How irresponsible of you to play
soccer without a helmet or kneepads.
It's good you didn't get killed.
Stop it! Stop hassling me.
I'm fucked up enough as it is
and I don't need your lectures.
What kind of language is that?
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Yeah.
And with the same mouth,
I puke and burp too!
The worst part was when he fell on us.
If I hadn't grabbed him,
he would have broken his neck.
How did he fall?
Your son is an idiot.
He flew about 30 feet. Look.
I swear on this...
He flew?
How can my son fly 30 feet?
Well, he really did.
He fell on David's feet,
on Fran's feet, on my feet...
since he flew,
he fell on our feet.
Mom, why don't you go get
us something to eat?
There's nothing,
but I understood you, baby.
I'll go to the store and get something.
What do you want?
A ham sandwich and a soda.
And please stop calling me baby.
- But I love calling you baby.
- No, Mom.
Beto, do you want to stay for supper?
OK, I'll just call my mother and
let her know I'll be with my ""baby"".
I won't take long. I'm leaving.
- OK, Mom.
- See you later.
- Baby...
- You idiot.
How can you say something
like that to my mother?
- What, ""baby""?
- No.
That lie you just told my mother.
What did you want me to say...
I had to convince her that her son
hadn't fallen from the wall.
You looked as if you had seen a ghost.
No, no...
Inside I saw two strangers.
What? Two strangers?
Well two people...
do you understand?
There were two people.
One was old and really weird...
and as I walked back
I ran into an old lady.
She was so ugly.
She looked at me with her big eyes.
Her skin was so wrinkled.
She had mummy's hands.
Don't be stupid. She looked weird
because she's a corpse.
Yeah, sure. A corpse wouldn't say
or scream anything the way she did.
But I told you that house is haunted.
Everybody knows it.
The corpse of Norma's mother
is in that house.
Who knows.
All I know is...
what I saw was no corpse.
What are you doing here?
You're the kid
from yesterday, aren't you?
I thought I told you
I never wanted to see you again.
That's not true.
What, you imbecile?
Don't talk to me that way.
Who are you to tell
me how to talk to you?
So you don't care who I am either?
Well, I'll talk to you, however I want.
You brat!
Why are you talking to me like that?
I don't care.
I'll speak to you however I want.
""I don' t care.""
You vulgar little boy!
Don't you know who I am?
Yes, you're the mother of
the person that used to kill women.
A murderer.
That's what they're saying
about me now?
I thought that time...
was enough for them to stop talking.
But now the rumors say that
I'm a witch and a murderer.
So, you're not?
If I were, what do you care?
What do you care if I care?
Aside from everything else,
you're also impudent.
That's how you must be in school, right?
No, school is total shit.
School is what?
School is shit.
I hate school.
Let's see, come.
Come on.
Come and sit down.
Come closer.
I'm not going to hurt you.
If I wanted to kill you
I would have done it by now.
Sit.
Why do you hate school?
Well, it busts my balls.
It busts your what?
My balls.
It's a drag, boring.
So, why does it bust your balls?
I don't know.
I have to wake up early,
and the worst part is when
the teachers yell at you.
They're crazy.
Crazy idiots.
Yes. They're idiots.
Imagine...
The other day,
my teacher started yelling at me...
because I didn't know
who Jose Vasconcelos was.
Jose Vasconcelos...
was a lover and a visionary.
What?
He was a dreamer...
giving the country books
like ""The Iliad"" or ""The Odyssey"".
Instead of feeding the poor.
That's nothing...
and what he did to Antonieta...
is unspeakable.
Anyway, tell me more about school.
Well... I think it's boring.
Waking up early, homework,
the worst is when they yell at you.
The teachers?
Yes, the teachers.
They treat us as
if we were stupid.
Like we don't deserve their patience.
Ignore them.
People who don't
feel sympathy are cowards.
But my mother
says that school is important.
Of course.
That's what she was told.
Then school is not important?
Yes, but other things
are important too.
Like what?
Like living,
feeling...
Ioving...
thinking.
Why did you break
into my property?
Don't you know it's forbidden?
- By whom?
- It's against the law.
They put kids like you in jail.
Why would they put me in jail?
What did I do?
Breaking into somebody's
property is nothing?
But I didn't steal or break anything.
So it doesn't matter that
you broke into my house?
Of course not.
I just wanted to see you.
Why do you keep on talking to me
as if we were equals?
You did the same thing.
But I'm older.
Older by age.
When you grow up, you'll learn that
elders should be respected.
What?
Only because you're older?
You're right
I was forgetting for a moment
that greatness doesn't come with age.
How pathetic!
To become what you fought against.
I forgot that we lose the battle
when we stop being ourselves.
I used to fight to be able
to express myself.
And now that I find...
somebody fighting to be heard,
I suppress him.
I'm becoming that which
I fought against.
Anyway, you'll understand
when you're older.
You'll see one day,
when you reach my age...
how it feels to realize
what you have become.
Well, now leave.
Hey! Don't climb the wall!
You're going to ruin it.
How? It's already ruined.
You spoiled brat.
Why do you talk to me that way?
Anyway, I'm leaving this way
because this is the way I came in.
I hope you break your head.
I'm becoming so pathetic.
You went back? What happened?
What did you see?
Nothing much...
A garden, an old house...
and an old lady.
It must be Norma's aunt then.
No, man. Come on.
There's nothing like that inside.
But everybody says that it's scary.
Scared, I was.
But not because of any corpse
or exorcist.
Why don't you go back in there
and look for the exorcist inside?
Oh please, man.
Yes, I'd go back but not to look
for your exorcists...
or anything weird.
Sorry.
As soon as I can.
Honey, your son.
Hi, baby.
I didn't hear you come in.
Don't call me ""baby"".
This is my... my boss.
Well, a friend at work, Armando.
I wanted him to meet you...
so you could see how...
Did you make anything to eat?
I didn't have time,
but what do you say...
the three of us
go out for tacos?
He likes them. So do you.
I think it's a good idea.
Yes?
No, thank you.
Jorge.
Listen, baby, where are you going?
To the store, to get myself
something to eat.
Do you have money?
You brat.
Didn't I tell you not
to climb up the wall?
Where do you want
me to come in from?
If I knocked, it would take you
months to answer the door.
You vulgar, idiot child.
- Talk to me with respect.
- I didn't mean to upset you.
Really? What did you expect?
I should be happy you called me old?
Don't pay attention to what
I say, only how I say it.
Unless you were an orphan,
or your mother were a whore,
you wouldn't be bothering
an old lady like me.
Don't ever say that again.
Do you hear me?
Again, you're talking
to me with no respect.
Don't ever call my mother
a slut. Got it?
And you, don't ever say
that I am old again.
What happened with your mother?
What do you mean?
Why don't you love her?
Of course I do.
So, why did you get angry
when I said she was a whore?
Because she isn't one.
If she weren't one you wouldn't
have gotten so angry.
Hey!
Come back.
I can't chase after you.
Come.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Your mother isn't what you think.
No?
No, she's just a woman.
What are you trying to say?
That women are not only mothers,
they're also women.
Is your mother young?
Is she ugly?
Of course not.
She's beautiful, like a princess.
If her son thinks she's a princess...
how will the rest of
the world see her?
But she's no slut.
She's a woman.
But you said she was a slut.
No.
I said she must be on the streets.
That's what I said.
Don't go changing it,
you said she was a slut.
And what do you care
what people think?
A lot. Don't you?
No. Locked up in here, you think
I care what happens out there?
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- No.
I decided long ago that what I
don't know, won't bother me.
You know, what the eye doesn't see...
So, rumors do bother you?
Why do you say that?
Because you prefer being
locked up in here...
than to listen to
what happens out there.
You may be right.
But there are a lot of people
who are more sensitive...
than they are strong.
And how does one become strong?
Very good question.
Do you know what a condom is?
What?
A condom.
- How old are you?
- Twelve.
Then you know what it is.
Yes, the thing like a balloon, right?
Yes, that ""balloon""...
is like a helmet.
You use it and it saves you
from a lot of problems.
What does that have to do
with being strong?
Well, you use it as a helmet
over your head...
and you don't hear what
people say about you.
What do you mean by ""people""?
Everybody.
- Everybody?
- Everybody.
Your friends, your teachers,
even your mother.
I think the opinion
of others is important.
But I do care what people think
of me and my stuff.
My boy,
don't tell me that you need others
to know who you really are?
This is the last straw.
The last straw.
I'm fed up.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me you got
suspended for a week from school?
Mom, it's only Saturday,
and it starts on Monday.
I don't care.
You should have told me yesterday.
What's going on with you?
How is being rude going to help you?
When are you going to learn
not to answer back?
Mom, don't exaggerate.
Why shouldn't I?
What are you going to do now?
Do you know what a week
without school means?
Yes, an entire week to goof off.
My God, Jorge, don't be cynical.
Stop joking around.
Don't you understand
how serious this is?
Don't you get it?
Do you know what not going
to school means?
If you don't go to school,
you're not going to amount to anything.
You won't have a career and without it
how will you earn a living?
Mom, calm down.
No, Jorge, I won't calm down.
And listen to me.
Don't talk to me as if we were equals.
I'm not going to let you
treat me that way.
You know what, Mom?
You're the one with the problem.
You don't fool me.
- What did you say, you imbecile?
- Don't insult me.
The real reason you're angry is because
I caught you with your boyfriend.
That's how you fix your problems?
Go ahead...
hit me
like if I were a punching bag.
You can't?
Show me what you've got.
Come on.
Hey, kid.
Why are you cutting my roses?
They're for the Virgin Mary,
don't you understand?
What bad manners.
Wait until your mother gets home.
I'm going to tell her.
Just you wait. You little bastard.
Hey, I'm talking to you!
I won't let you forget this.
You'll remember me.
You little bastard!
Lady, are you there?
Lady?
Come in.
You came early today.
Yes, I didn't go to school.
Why?
I got suspended for a week.
At least you'll be able to
sleep in for a week.
Who are those people?
My parents.
Why does your father have a cap on?
It's not a cap it's a kepi.
My father was a captain.
He commanded 5,000 soldiers
during the revolution.
What are you doing?
Writing, can't you see?
What are you writing?
What do you care?
Are you going to start?
And you say that I'm the brat.
And you're going to start
talking to me as an equal?
Yeah, so?
That's your problem.
Who's the old man that was outside
when I came the first time?
Melquiades.
I thought you lived alone.
I'm glad you came,
I need you to go get me cigarettes.
- Cigarettes?
- Yes.
Carmencitas.
- Why don't you ask Melquiades to go?
- Because I don't feel like it.
They won't sell them to me.
Don't be ridiculous.
If you can climb the wall...
you can certainly find a way
to buy me cigarettes.
I'm 12, they won't sell them to me.
Have you ever bought any?
No.
So, how do you know?
Why do you say things
you know nothing about?
What brand did you want?
Carmencitas or Faros.
What now?
Are you going to stab me?
Of course not.
You're wasting your time
if you think you can hurt me.
Nobody beats me.
Faros or Carmencitas.
No junk.
- What?
- I need money.
Here.
One pack will be plenty until Thursday.
I was wrong, again.
He does understand me.
Jorge?
Jorge?
Honey, what's wrong?
Why are you all wet?
What's wrong?
My God, are you OK?
Honey, what's wrong?
How inconsiderate.
- It's so late.
- Yes...
I'm sorry,
but what happened was...
What happened?
I had a problem.
- What? What happened to the book?
- The book is fine.
I've fixed the problem.
It's just that they
didn't have the copies ready.
What?
Yes, he said he'd have
them on Monday.
What were they thinking?
We need them tonight.
Tell me about it.
- Why didn't they have them on time?
- I don't know, honey.
- It's not my fault.
- It can't be.
You can't trust anybody these days.
Was the teacher right, after all?
Mexico is how it is because
you can't trust anyone.
- I know, take it easy.
- I can't believe it.
Listen, I have a solution.
My friend Marco will...
- Who's Marco?
- A friend.
He will make us the copies
on his computer.
They won't be the best copies,
but they'll do.
So we're going to turn those in?
It's better than nothing.
I don't know, I still can't believe
they weren't ready.
Let's call Marco.
I don't want you to get sick.
Do you like roses?
It's not whether I like them or not.
It's what they remind me of.
- What do you mean?
- You see...
outside, there is a very dry rosebush.
Because Melquiades never
watered my garden.
I never took care of the roses.
And since they were given to me,
I never watered them, you see.
But I saw you trying to fix it
the other day.
I remembered my friend
who gave it to me.
Who was your friend?
Diego Rivera.
That name sounds familiar.
How can it not?
Aren't you Mexican?
Yes.
Who was he?
He was a painter, muralist, a genius.
Look, he did that painting.
Why are you dressed like an Indian?
That was his style.
Where did you meet him?
In New York.
You've been to New York?
Yes, I lived there for 20 years.
You lived 20 years in New York?
What's so weird about that?
It's just a regular city.
But if you want to know
a beautiful city... Paris.
Now that's a beautiful city.
You've been to Paris?
Yes, but not vey well as I lived in
Montparnasse and I didn't go out much.
That kind of trip should
cost a lot of money.
What did you do for a living?
What do you care?
You're going to start again?
I don't like talking about that.
That's not fair.
I've told you everything about me.
Ah, yes.
Really?
Yes, I've told you everything.
- Yes. Everything... everything.
- Yes, everything.
You think you're so smart!
You know who you remind me of?
Alfonso Reyes.
You knew him also?
Oh, my child.
You never really know a person.
You didn't get along
with men, did you?
No, it's not that.
I never understood them.
Did you have any women friends?
Yes.
Frida...
Nahui, Antonieta, Gaby.
Gaby was very beautiful.
Gaby?
Yes, Gaby Mistral.
Did you say Gabriela Mistral?
Gabriela Mistral.
That's the name of my school.
They named your school after Gaby?
What's so funny?
Gaby was opposed to everything
that they teach in school.
Why?
You know what one of
her poems was called?
Tenderness.
Something they don't
practice or teach in schools.
Now what are you laughing about?
That.
You're so funny.
Hi, Mom.
Where were you?
At my friend's house.
Which friend?
The old lady that lives in the
big house on Morelia Street.
Why so late?
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
What about school?
Mom, I was suspended.
Yes, but that doesn't give you the right
to wander the streets with your friends.
Calm down.
Listen to me, Jorge.
No, no, no... don't treat me
like some crazy woman.
Like a crazy woman, Mom?
You're already crazy.
Foul mouthed.
It's not fair that I work like a dog
while you are on the streets.
Listen to me.
Where were you all morning?
I already told you.
I was with my friend.
Now an old lady is your friend?
She is. Not only is she fun
but she's very smart.
Now you go see
old people for charity?
You're such a hypocrite.
You don't even like
your grandmother.
Don't compare them.
My grandma is as crazy as you.
And you two do nothing but fight.
Honey, listen to me.
Can't you understand that
I'm worried about you?
I don't want you hanging around
with the wrong kind of people.
Please, Mom. If someone here
is doing that, it's you.
You don't get it. You don't get it!
When are you going to learn, Jorge?
When are you going to learn
to shut up.
Jorge, listen to me...
And you, Mom...
have you ever listened to me?
Jorge del Pino, stand up please.
What did you learn during your
little week of vacation?
Did you learn anything about
the famous authors of Mexico?
Yes, I did, I learned a lot.
Ah, yes?
Like what?
I learned that Diego Rivera was
a very thoughtful man...
he wouldn't hesitate for a moment...
to give a friend a beautiful
rosebush for her garden.
I learned that Jose
Vasconcelos was a naive man...
he didn't realize that his people...
preferred food to books like
""The Odyssey"" or ""The Iliad"".
I also learned that Gabriela Mistral
knew how to be a friend.
That New York is as beautiful
as any other city.
But Paris... Paris is the
most beautiful city in the world.
And only one woman was able to...
meet and befriend this group of men...
women and artists.
But the most important thing I learned...
was that I don't need anybody
or anything to be happy...
and to know who I really am.
That's what I learned.
Is there anything else
you want to know?
Where did you get all that stuff
you told the teacher?
I didn't invent it.
I'm not like you.
Where did you get it from?
It's the lady from the big house,
she taught me everything.
You still see her?
Of course.
In fact, I'm going now.
Do you want to come?
No, no, thank you.
I have a lot of homework to do.
Homework, man?
We don't have any homework.
Well, I have to start studying
for tomorrow's lesson.
Yeah... right.
Fuck off.
Don't talk to your daddy that way.
I'm leaving.
How come you like to visit her?
Don't you get bored?
No.
Why do you go?
I don't know.
She's like the grandmother
I never had.
Me?
Your grandmother?
I'd shoot myself first.
Seriously.
I never wanted children,
forget about grandchildren.
- You never got married?
- I didn't say that.
I said I never had children.
Why didn't you want to have kids?
Because...
some people are difficult.
Well, it's not that I wouldn't
have wanted kids.
It's just that I wouldn't
have made them happy.
Why?
Because I wasn't happy.
And...
are you happy now?
In this moment, I am.
What did you do?
About what?
Work?
I used to write.
Where?
In a notebook, wherever.
I understand that.
What, for a newspaper, a magazine?
I don't want to talk about that.
How did you buy this house?
It's must have been pretty
when it was new.
Very pretty.
It was a gift.
From whom?
Let's leave it at that.
Who was it, a friend,
did you get along?
It was his way of telling me
he loved me.
Did you have friends that
were writers, like you?
They weren't writers.
They were artists.
One of them was Dali.
He was very funny.
He was a great man.
BuÃuel...
BuÃuel was written in capital letters.
He was an incredible man.
You never knew whether he was
joking or being serious.
And where are they now?
Dali is in Spain.
And BuÃuel unfortunately, is in heaven.
Why did you stop seeing them?
Ah, fame.
- Fame?
- Yes.
They became very famous.
Dali making portraits of himself
for the journalists.
Fame overwhelmed everybody,
some even believed in it.
And what happened to the others?
We grew apart.
It always happens.
The first time, it happened
to me here in Mexico.
Then I went to Spain looking for
a group of intellectuals...
and a few years later
the same thing happened.
Then, I went to France
and the same thing.
Everybody falls for fame.
Everybody.
That's why I ran away from it.
You... were you famous?
Dummy, didn't I just tell you that
I ran away from it?
Why do you say that
fame is dangerous?
Because you start believing in it.
People and the press
applaud the character.
Not the person.
They applaud the artist.
And the artist, my boy,
is only a character.
They only care if you're
important and famous.
They don't care who you really are.
They say they love and admire you.
But if ever you should
need anybody because you're ill...
or just need company
when you're alone...
they would never be there.
Because in the end
they don't care about you.
They only care what you represent.
That's why you can never
make a mistake...
because they would never
forgive you for it.
They will never treat you...
like a real person.
That was what my friends
never understood.
You never wanted to be famous?
No, I was never interested.
Now go home.
I don't want you getting in trouble
with your mother.
No. Don't worry.
Tell me more about... Doli?
What was it?
About BuÃuelos...
Tell me about him. Yes, yes...
Is it true that New York
is full of skyscrapers?
Tell me more... I won't have
problems with my mother.
Yes, come on...
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
Are you in pain?
I wouldn't have acted
like that if I weren't.
Tell me what's wrong.
Only a few bruises
I have from last week.
Really?
Yes.
Don't worry.
Don't start with me.
No.
Easter week is not possible.
Mother, I haven't had time
to go to Queretaro.
We're both very upset and I don't
want to say anything we'll both regret.
Call you later, bye.
Where were you?
Why were you fighting
with grandma?
She wants us to go
to Queretaro for the holidays.
As if I were at her beck and call.
She's crazy.
I already made plans.
With whom?
Your boyfriend?
Don't be so rude.
I'm your mother.
Please, Mom.
Did you notice the way
you were talking to yours?
Actually I was thinking that
you should go alone.
Me?
Where?
Queretaro.
What am I going to do there?
Don't be a bad grandson.
My mother wants to see you.
What for?
So she can give me rotten candy
and walk me like a dog?
Don't be like that.
She really wants to see you.
You don't think you have
obligations with your family?
Only when you need
money or toys.
But of your own free will never.
How selfish!
Hello?
Hi.
Yes.
Yes.
Hold on.
Go to your room!
Yes, at what time?
Which one? Where?
- And why don't you want to go?
- What for?
I'll only get bored.
My grandmother is the weirdest,
most boring, most hateful person I know.
And she also smells funny.
But she's your grandmother.
I know, but I can't stand her.
What's so funny?
You look funny when you're angry.
Not more than you.
Look, boy.
I'm going to give you some advice.
Something I never do.
Do you want to go?
No, no.
Then don't go.
What?
That's right, don't go.
Why not?
If you decided it, go through with it.
How?
By not going.
That easy?
It's simple.
It would be another world if
we all did what we really thought.
But we always think something
and do something else.
That's why the world is the way it is.
But not everything we want is correct.
How do I know if what
I want to do is the right thing?
Easy.
Follow your instinct.
That's all.
Instinct?
I'm going to tell you something.
What do you do first?
Take a shit or eat?
Well, first I eat and
then I take a dump.
Well...
That sounds logical.
But some people take
a shit and then they eat.
You have to follow your instinct.
That's all.
How did you come up
with all these ideas?
How do you make them up?
I don't make them up.
It's just life.
I give myself time to think.
What?
Doesn't everybody think?
People have to give
themselves time to love...
to eat, time for everything.
How do you know
when you're in love?
You like someone, don't you?
Yeah, a girl I saw
the other day in the park.
Has she said anything to you?
No.
Have you?
Have you kissed her
or given her a flower?
No. I only think she's cute.
I think the only thing
you like is her butt.
Do you think that people
think when they're in love?
No.
People in love...
only love.
Have you ever been in love?
Yes, a long time ago.
Who was he?
The man of my life.
He was smart, educated.
He learned a lot about life.
He was fabulous.
What was his name?
What do you care?
I'm sorry.
My child.
I've told you that names
are not important.
Memories are important.
How was he?
Wonderful.
He painted, he wrote.
He was a poet.
He spoiled me.
Brought me flowers.
He'd serenade me.
But the jerk never worked.
And where is he now?
Dead.
Do you miss him?
Sometimes.
How do you... how do you go on?
How do you make
the pain go away?
I write.
That's right.
I saw you writing the other day.
I can still do it, but...
I don't like writing much anymore.
Tell me more.
Did you guys get married?
No, he got married.
He left you?
No, we split up.
And...
Who was he?
How many times do I have
to tell you that...
names are not important.
What's important are
the memories, what we did.
When was the last time you saw him?
Thirty years ago.
What were your last words?
Good bye.
What?
We're going to Queretaro?
Yes, honey, we're leaving
after tomorrow.
But why?
You didn't want to go.
You got me thinking.
It's been a while since
we've seen my mother...
and I didn't want
you to go alone.
Please, give me a break, Mom.
I think you got in a fight with your
boyfriend and that's why we're going.
Don't start.
You never tell me the truth.
You are always lying to me.
Always coming up with excuses.
Mom, I always find out
what you're up to.
Tell me the truth.
You want the truth?
OK. You are my son.
You're my baby and I love you.
I know you don't care.
I've loved you since
I got pregnant with you.
But what you don't know is that my mother
beat me when she knew I was pregnant...
She thought I was crazy
and told me not to have you.
But I fought for you and I had you.
And that's why we're together now.
I work only to give you the best.
It's not that I don't
want to be with you.
I'm not a bad mother.
I'd never do anything to hurt you.
I just want to provide for you.
School, clothes, toys.
Everything I do is for you.
Let's go to Queretaro.
Mom.
Do it.
Do it for me.
You're leaving tomorrow?
Why?
You're leaving tomorrow?
Why?
My mother asked me to go
and I couldn't say no.
I thought you hated your grandmother.
What, now you like her?
No.
But, I'm going for my mother.
And, besides, she's right.
We haven't gone on vacation
in a long time.
But the only thing that bothers me is
not seeing my friend, the old lady.
Did you tell her yet?
Yeah, she knows. But I haven't said
good-bye yet. I'm going there right now.
Hey, Melquiades.
Lady?
Lady?
Lady, it's me, Jorge!
Lady?
Are you here?
Lady?
It's me, Jorge!
Jorge?
Your name is Jorge?
Do you know what
you've done for me?
Do you know what you
brought back to my life?
Come.
Please, put it on the table.
Thank you.
I know you're scared.
A little startled, I would be too.
In fact,
I would've run by now.
What's inside the chest?
A gift.
A gift?
Yes.
For you.
For me?
Yes.
What's inside?
That's what I wanted to tell you.
You can not take it until you
promise me something.
Me?
Swear on your life...
promise me you won't open it...
until you are twenty.
Twenty years old?
And why until twenty?
Because that's how old I was...
when I was discovered.
Promise.
I came to tell you something.
I came to tell you that I'm leaving...
to Queretaro, you remember?
My mother is going.
Do you know what a memory is?
You know, a memory...
a caress...
a smile?
A memory is a lifetime.
When you grow up,
your heart will understand.
Ah, my child...
I'm sorry, I'm not being clear
with you now.
But I can't.
I just freed up my intuition.
I was finally able to live.
I haven't been this alive
for the past twenty-five years.
Are you feeling OK?
You're not sick or anything?
No, I'm fine.
OK, then, I have to go because...
Because my mother is waiting for me.
I have to pack.
Are you scared?
Scared, me? No...
It's just that my mother asked me
to get home early.
So I can finish packing.
You won't be the same.
Your mother has learned
to dominate you.
And you gave in.
You won't be the same.
Today, you stopped
believing in yourself.
But it doesn't matter.
I understand you.
Take it, it's yours.
Thank you.
Don't thank me.
Thank you.
I have to go.
Bye, Jorge.
How do you know my name?
You told me.
You said, ""Lady, it's me, Jorge!""
And what's your name?
Esperanza.
Jorge.
Good-bye.
- I'll be right back, Mom.
- Where are you going?
To see my friend.
- I won't be long.
- You have to help me.
- Mom.
- You can't leave me like this.
- Yeah.
- You have to help me unpack.
Don't leave me like this, Jorge.
You have to help me.
- See you later.
- Where are you going?
We want it to look
good enough to sell.
So we need to keep up
the maintenance on the house.
We're checking all the electrical...
checking all the plumbing...
Trimming the shrubs.
Then we will start installing
all new plumbing.
All new electrical...
Check all the plumbing, water.
I don't want any problems.
Sir, what's going on?
I don't want any problems leaks.
Good afternoon, sir.
Check all the breakers, the switches,
the hardware...
Hey, mister, what's going on?
Excuse me, the lady of the house?
What's happening?
Hey, mister.
I don't know.
What's happening?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Gaby, are you done?
Hey, boy,
what are you doing here?
Hi, Melquiades.
- It's me, Jorge.
- Jorge? The lady...
She died on Thursday.
We buried her on Friday.
No.
That can't be.
Yes, she died.
She had pulmonary emphysema.
She also had liver problems.
For many years, people thought
she was already dead.
It can't be.
I saw her on Wednesday.
I just saw her.
Are you OK boy?
Are you OK?
Can I help you?
I can't believe you didn't help me.
What's wrong?
What happened?
Jorge!
Open the door.
What's wrong?
Did they do something to you?
Tell me.
Answer me!
No!
Jorge, it's an earthquake.
Come.
Take it easy.
Calm down.
Everything is going to be OK.
Calm down.
Here you go, honey.
This is disgusting!
Why didn't you use more eggs?
You should have used three eggs.
We're eating eggs.
But it's very late.
What does that
have to do with the eggs?
I hope they'll reschedule
our meeting until Wednesday.
You know what assholes
the council can be.
Did my mother call?
No, I think you should
call her tonight.
I seriously think my mother is crazy.
Don't say that.
She's been really nice.
She gave us this apartment.
Yes, because she was scared.
Her and grandma always argued, but
she moved in with her after the earthquake.
They used to fight like dogs
and ended up living together.
I have to go, it's getting late.
My love.
Before you leave, we should talk.
What?
About the wedding?
Lety, it's really... getting late,
you know how work can be.
My love.
What?
Then, when?
I really want to marry you.
Let's meet this afternoon in the
coffee shop across the street?
Come on, honey.
We'll set the date and everything.
- Yes?
- That's fine.
OK.
I love you.
- Take care.
- OK.
- Bye.
- OK. Bye.
Take a fruit.
- Here.
- Thanks.
You should hurry up too,
you're going to be late.
- Bye, honey.
- I love you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Go, you're going to be late.
Did you see?
Yes, I've already seen your PDA.
Twenty minutes.
Don't start, traffic was a killer.
You should buy yourself a car.
What for?
I'll go crazy with a car.
How did the meeting go?
It didn't happen.
I told you. Those assholes
order me around like a dog.
Are you going to start complaining?
I'm not complaining.
I'm just fed up.
They treat me bad,
they boss me about, they use me.
Don't think about it.
I'm serious, Leticia...
Calm down.
Why don't we talk about the wedding?
Wedding? What for?
To make me more nervous?
No, honey, forgive me.
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
You know how I get.
Traffic, the bus...
work.
I'm sorry. What do you
want to talk about?
When do you want to get married?
Well, I've really thought it over.
That's what I wanted to talk about.
- What about Chimalistac?
- Yes, sure.
Where's Chimalistac?
It's the church where
my parents got married.
Do you prefer day or night?
I would prefer at night.
April 17th is the
anniversary of the death...
- of Miss Esperanza Malagon Prieto.
- Do you prefer a big wedding or...
a tribute will be held in her honor.
She was recognized internationally
as a brilliant artist...
this tribute will be held
next Friday at 22:30...
in the Casa Lamm in Mexico City.
Near where the artist lived...
for nearly thirty years.
In 1939, Miss Esperanza Malagon Prieto,
became the first Latin American woman...
to receive an International
prize for literature.
She also created the women's
writers movement in Latin-America.
Miss Esperanza received all kinds
of recognition during her lifetime.
But, we know that Miss Esperanza
was a woman...
who rejected all kinds
of awards and tributes...
which is why we...
are finally paying homage to her
on the anniversary of her death...
This well deserved tribute
will be held on Friday.
There were many rumors among...
certain circles of the existence
of an unpublished book...
that she wrote during the 70's entitled
""The Hypocrite's Conduct"".
It was never found
among her belongings...
after her death in 1984.
This well deserved tribute
to this artist who was...
internationally renowned and brought
recognition to her native Mexico...
Honey, don't leave me hanging like this.
THE H YPOCRITE'S CONDUCT
I don't know who you are.
I don't even know your name.
This is the third time I've seen you
and I've decided to leave this to you.
Would you believe me if I said
that I don't need this anymore...
I don't want any of this anymore...
and, would you believe if I said,
I never wanted it...
because, my boy, awards are
not only to humiliate the loser...
but also the winner...
because when somebody wins
in front of others...
he is only humiliating himself.
That bunch of hypocrites
who applaud me...
and pretend to like me,
don't even know who I am.
They don't truly know me.
They don't know what
makes me happy or sad.
They only know that
I am successful,
and that's why they award me.
You don't need anyone to be happy...
you don't need anything to be happy.
You only have to feel it...
feel that you're happy...
feel the pleasure of living...
My boy,
don't become what I've become today.
For the past years...
I failed to follow my instinct
and I ended up betraying myself.
Never betray your childhood...
live your life as though
you were two years old...
and didn't know anything about
fear, repression...
or what people thought of you.
Enjoy life the same way you enjoyed
your first touch of water...
like you enjoyed
your mother's first caress.
Enjoy it and live it.
Don't believe me
if you don't want to...
just try it.
By the way...
I give you my book to publish...
and may this letter bear witness so
nobody can take it from you.
And with this letter, I leave you...
my boy...
whoever you may be...
and I hope this money will help you,
even if briefly...
your friend, Esperanza.
Honey, good news.
Marco is coming with the copies
of Miss Esperanza's book.
Please, don't overreact.
He's on his way,
don't worry, he won't be late.
Honey, what's wrong?
That was it, Lety.
What happened to me
the past seventeen years?
If I had it all? Why...
why did I let it all go?
But, why?
I... I had everything to succeed.
Why did I stop being myself?
Why?
Here comes Marco.
- How are you, Lety?
- Good, you?
- What have you been up to?
- Waiting for you.
- Something happened.
- What?
- I couldn't get the fifty copies.
- What do you mean?
- I only have sixteen.
- That's OK.
- It doesn't matter?
- No, no, no.
I should have printed one...
and photocopied the rest.
But you pressured me so much...
- Don't worry about it, thank you.
- You're sure?
No problem.
Listen, I want you to meet Jorge.
- OK.
- OK.
Honey, this is Marco.
- Hi, Jorge. How are you?
- Hi.
He helped us with the copies.
- You're Marco?
- Yes. How are you?
Thank you. Thanks.
- I could only make sixteen copies.
- That's fine, great.
- How much do we owe you?
- Please, don't even think about it.
Really?
I think we should start going in.
Good evening.
Are you looking for someone?
Me?
Not really.
Is the tribute for Miss Esperanza
Malagon Prieto being held here?
Are you a writer?
A poet? Or something?
Poet? No.
What? Do I have to be
a poet to be here?
Hello, Jorge.
So, what do you think?
How do you see them?
Who?
What do you mean who?
Idiot.
What, don't you understand
what I'm saying?
They're a bunch of dumb asses.
They think they're intellectuals,
they think they're artists, geniuses...
but they're nothing.
That's what I ran away from.
And now, what's wrong with you?
I've missed you so much.
And now you talk to me with respect.
Have you stopped
being who you were?
You think so?
Look at yourself.
You don't answer back anymore,
you don't know what to say.
What can I say?
Tell me...
What the hell have you
done with yourself?
Why are you wearing a suit?
Don't you see?
You've become mediocre.
Your mother convinced you.
And now you are not who you were...
But I swear...
If I had known you as a boy...
to be as mediocre as you are now...
I would never have left you my book.
What can I do?
Be yourself...
don't make the same mistakes I made.
Don't be like them.
They pretend to be something they're not.
Be yourself...
and not what they want you to be.
Who am I?
You?
You are the one who
reminded me who I was.
Jorge?
What are you doing?
IN MEMORY OF
WE REMEMBER YOU WITH LOVE
YOUR ABILITIES ARE MUCH GREATER
ANYONE HAS EVER MADE YOU BELIEVE
TRUE HAPPINESS COMES FROM INSIDE
THANKS TO OUR FRIEND
EDUARDO PALOMO"
18,A Bee in August (2007) - full transcript,"Harris, his wife, his mistress and his half German sister arrive with a boat to a distant Aegean island, assessable only by boat. The boat man forgets them and they are stranded there. Harris gets stung by a bee, and he develops an allergy. He gets terribly swollen and his alter ego emerges. Suddenly all secrets, hidden truths and feelings come into the open.","In August, Flies Are Fat.
That's how my brother Haris
named his book.
The book touches upon all matters:
9/11, Gandhi, global warming...
The accompanying DVD
includes scenes from our vacation.
I'll read you an extract.
""Did you ever wonder
what makes a novel a best seller?
""Maybe, a story based on real facts.""
""Yet, Galileo got into trouble
proving the heliocentric theory..
...""because his society wasn't ready
for this kind of truth.""
""Could it be that a book's success lies
in the consumer, and not the writer?""
I'm like all Nobel winners
before getting awarded.
They had nothing, just like me!
My brother is treated by
Dr. Maria Giannakoudakis.
She was with you at the beach.
Yes...
Maria Giannakoudakis,
the psychiatrist.
However, there was also
some Petra Hiphelsbach.
Himmelsbach!
HiIeIsbach...
Himmelsbach!
Himmelsbach!
Way to go!
Hildegard... Just a moment...
Your honor, she speaks Greek well.
It would make it easier for us,
if you don't mind...
Proceed.
Hildegard, will you speak in Greek?
You master the language, shall we try?
We zaII try.
Marvellous! So, at the beach,
there was also some Petra HiIesbach.
You can access
this beach only by boat.
Also, nobody goes to zis island.
Harry's the only one who knows it.
50, Maria had to come vith us
and ve told Haris's wife...
...she vas a friend of mine
from Germany.
Maria Giannakoudakis
is Petra Himmelsbach.
-Maria can speak German?
-No...
How could she then pass
for a German?
Ze pretended to be deaf-mute!
What language do you speak
with your brother?
Greek...
Haris doesn't speak German.
How come?
We are half siblings.
Our father was Greek.
My mother is German,
Haris's is Greek.
Haris is Greek, I'm half Greek...
...but mostly German
'cause I grew up there.
Let's make a brief recap to
prevent misunderstandings, ok?
Well...
It was on an August morning...
A BEE IN AUGUST
Manolis, pick us up at around 5.
Tell you mom to have
the mackerels ready.
Vasso, it's been 4 days now,
we have been eating only mackerels!
We're like Captain Cousteau's crew!
-But they're fresh!
So were Cousteau's fish! But
they ate marinara for a change.
Even sailors get sick of fish,
I'm just a writer!
Mackerels are off!
-But I told the poor woman.
You should have asked me, too!
Hilda, mackerels again?
Petra, do you want to eat fish?
See? Nobody wants fish.
Petra doesn't count.
She is eating like a bird.
I can't believe that
deaf-mutes can actually live.
I mean, I get dizzy
when my ears get clogged.
Her ears are not clogged...
She was born this way.
Well, just forget it...
I'm going for a svim.
Me too...
Will you join me?
No, I'll come in a bit...
-Want me to wait for you?
-Go ahead and I'll follow...
Ok then, I'll wait for you.
-Why don't you go?
-Do you mind me waiting?
Why should I mind?
I'm getting into the water.
So, Haris,
are you having a good time?
No, I'm a little bit stressed out.
-I don't see why.
-What?
-You don't seem stressed out.
-Let me be the judge of that.
Right...
What are stressed out about?
Can we talk? When Vasso returns,
I have to become a deaf-mute again!
It was your idea
to be a deaf-mute.
Would you prefer me
to chitchat with your wife?
-Do you think it's better now?
-It's just great!
Yeah, right. Look at this...
Sunscreen, grass,
the"" American Idol"" CD...
...like a teen's holiday.
- Haris, quit it!
I quitted everything, dear.
I quitted drinking, smoking...
Like Kazantzakis' quote...
...""I fear nothing,
I hope for nothing, I am free"".
Because he had confused
freedom with depression!
Why didn't you let me
go to Thassos?
Go where? To Thassos?
With Klapanaras?
Was I in your way?
I just asked
why you didn't let me go.
-Are you serious?
-You think it's better here?
Why? Don't you like it here?
-The beach is nice...
-Don't you like the village?
-It's just one nice village.
-Did I say there were two of them?
-And you've been coming 4 years now?
-Mano|is is from this village.
Vasso tutors him
during winter, for free...
...so we come here
in the summer, you know...
You really pissed me off...
Why?
About Thassos.
Why do you want to go there?
To visit the island!
I've never been there.
You didn't give a shit about Thassos
'til he invited you, right?
I can't understand
why you are crazy about him.
-Who, me?
-Seems like it...
Is it because he's got money?
Yeah, black money! I know
all about tax evasions myself.
They rip off state funds and
then they pose for the camera.
Mr. Klapanaras is now
a bright business man...
...a celebrity, as if!
Why are you stressed out?
-Because of my book.
-Why? It will be a success.
-You really think so?
-I think you're talented...
...but you must be worse
than what I think.
You have 2 conflicting ideas
of me at the same time?
I have idolized you
because I am in love.
When this is over,
I'll know what you're worth.
I see... Then, I won't care about
what you think.
If you do that,
you'll be a real prick!
Vasso's opinion
is more important?
-What's up with you now?
-No, you listen!
Because I pretend to be mute,
it doesn't mean I am!
When will she stop?
Don't you love me?
Easy, honey,
she can see us.
So what? I am a deaf-mute
and I got dizzy.
Maria, please...
Love, I beg you to stop...
When I say please, I mean it!
What do you want?
Stop begging,
you're making a fool of yourself.
What's wrong now?
-Put some lotion on my back.
-How? What if she sees us?
You'll tell her you helped me
'cause I couldn't do it.
I see you have it
all planned out.
Move your hand.
You think Vasso is stupid.
She's nice, not stupid.
-What's the difference?
She'll go to heaven anyway,
but I'll go to hell.
That leaves no place
for me to go then.
Why you don't break up with me?
Because I love you.
I don't know how I do it.
I'm good at making relationships...
...but I just can't tell the other
that I want to break up.
If you really want it,
you can do it.
Yes, but I never wanted
to break up with nobody.
Unless they wanted to hurt me.
I can't divorce Vasso, either.
She really loves me.
Do you love her?
Yes, I really do.
Fine. Then, why
don't you break up with me?
Because I love you...
Is the deaf-mute hitting
on you or what?
-Are you serious, Vasso?
-Why is she still here then?
You think this means
she's hitting on me?
Of course! She'll follow you
into the water as weâ, try her.
-Vasso, I'm not in the mood.
-Go into the water, I say!
-Why don't you get lost?
-You're chicken?
-Enough with that crap!
-You're chicken.
-Who's chicken?
-You, 'cause I'm right.
You say, if I go into the sea,
Petra will follow me.
Should I go straight in
or dive off the rocks?
I don't care!
If she won't follow....
...I'll let you do me!
Jesus!
Maria, have you lost it?
As if I would let you screw her!
Why are you laughing?
It seems funny, now.
What seems funny?
That we were pretending,
that I freaked out, all of it.
Picture Haris having sex
in sign language!
He would kill her!
Do you think Haris is capable
of killing somebody?
Everyone is capable of killing...
...everyone, but Haris.
-How can you be so sure?
It'd be like Maria Teressa
becoming a terrorist!
You had to see him
when he was stung by a bee.
He swells up terribly!
-God Damn!
-What's wrong, dear?
A bee is after me!
Why is it after you?
I forgot to ask!
I saw it and I dove to escape...
...but it was waiting for me.
-Why did you come out?
To smell the roses!
Even dolphins come out for air!
-Where's the cortisone?
-Why?
You know that
if it stings me I'll swell up.
The doctor said to carry
cortisone always with me.
Come on, where is it?
-Ok, I'll look for it in a bit.
-You forgot where you put it?
I don't remember
if I took it with me.
-What?
-Stop shouting!
Are you serious? I'll die!
-I have many things on my mind.
-But you always bring toilet paper!
Mercy! I just forgot one thing!
See? She says
she is trying to kill me!
You can be such an ass sometimes.
It's official,
I forgot the cortisone.
Don't be scared, you wimp!
I'm not a wimp!
Don't move! It'll go avay.
No, it got tangled in the towel.
Haris, vhat's wrong?
This shitty bee stung me!
It was clear it didn't like me.
Is it five yet?
-Yes! It's twenty to eleven.
-I start to flare up.
-It's fine, relax.
It's 10:40, my name is Haris
and I'm allergic...
Guys, I'm transforming!
-We should pee on you.
-Or just shoot me.
Go into the water,
it'll do you good.
Sting's out!
What are we going to do?
He's going to swell up.
Where's my cell phone?
-Shit, no signal! Yours?
- I forgot it in the room.
Haris forgot his as well!
Does Petra have a cell phone?
Of course!
But, how can she use it?
She communicates
through text messages!
Great! What's her operator?
It's not Cosmote!
But zis phone
hasn't got signal either.
This means that
112 is not available.
-Why?
-To dial 112...
...you must have access
to at least one operator...
...who's going to allow
only emergency calls.
Did we have to choose Robinson's
island for a fucking swim?
Sea's iodine and crap!
How can iodine
do me any good now?
I don't believe my eyes!
I was the black swan
and became swan's lake!
It's... nothing...
Nothing at all...
Manolis will come and
you'll get your cortisone...
By then, I will most
probably need only formaldehyde!
Petra is trying to say something?
How many words?
Right, she both mute and German.
I don't believe it!
Quit that slapping!
Seven words?
I won't find it, period!
Is there an article?
No article? We're screwed!
Sea weed. Sea weed?
She's describing the buoy!
The sea?
-All of us?
-Everybody in the water?
Front crawl!
Backstroke!
- She'll go there on foot.
- Get serious!
Swimming?
-Swimming.
Petra will swim...
back to the island...
...to visit the church!
An ass?
No, she's swimming to Myconos!
Drugs...
She'll quit taking drugs.
-Will you cut the crap?
Stop, I found it.
""The big blue""!
By Luc Besson.
Zink straight!
Why are the Germans attacking us?
Vasso, shut up!
Nize, very nize!
Petra will bring a doctor
to give you the shot.
Where from?
The village is 3 miles away!
Not even Johnny Weissmuller
could swim that far!
I got it! She'll swim
only with one hand...
...holding the cell phone
with her free hand...
...and call once it regains signal!
What a great plan!
Right, but how will
she talk on the phone?
Of course, mute people
can't talk, right?
Then I'll go.
Give me a cell phone.
No, I'll just take mine.
-Hurry!
Hurry... It's spreading.
- Don't worry, I'll save you.
Save me! Call my name
and save me from the dark!
Hurry up!
What you want these for?
-I swim only with flippers on.
Go! Go! Good luck.
Don't be scared, you wimp!
I'm not a wimp!
Hilda, will you stop it
with the video-camera?
You're just like Michael Moore.
-Vhat's wrong, Haris?
Give me a break! I can't
be perfect all the time!
-Calm down, love.
-I am human, too!
She dared call me a wimp!
-Wimp is better that chicken.
Let him be. At first
he was afraid and petrified...
...now he grows strong
and learns how to carry on.
Stop scratzing,
you'll make it vorse!
-Can it get any worse?
-She's right, stop it.
Are you tripping?
I feel weedy and sick!
Look at her! I said weedy
and she remembered her weed!
- You think I don't give a shit?
- Go to hell!
Zis anxiety only
makes things vorse.
Right, keeping calm
is a life saver.
You're a doctor, don't you carry
vith you anything that could help him?
I wasn't prepared for an isle.
He should have known better.
I thought Vasso
would bring the cortisone.
Only Sissies care about that stuff.
But you're a real man
with a harem!
Sadly, I don't see
any good coming out of it.
-It's my fault that I came.
-You should have gone to Thassos.
You don't belong to the isle.
You should be with Klapanaras!
-Have you lost it?
-With Klapanaras, I say!
Just what I wanted to say!
-This tourist needs help?
-ViII you stop?
It's important to see
where we go from here.
Stop scratching!
-I can't help it.
-Should we tie him up?
-I prefer Chinese torture.
He feels itchy
because of the salt.
If we rinse it off,
he'll feel better.
But who's going to get the water?
-Me!
You think that's enough?
- Is that all the water we've got?
- We'll have more at five o'clock!
Guys!
I want to drink something first,
my mouth's dry.
We should save some
for Vasso, too.
She forgot the cortisone
so I'll have her share.
-No, she went to get help.
-Bring it back!
We'll save up some for her.
If she dehydrates,
2 sick people are really bad news.
You listen? This is
sober German thinking.
You're emotional and full of crap.
You should never see Vasso sick.
When she was admitted
at the clinic...
Why was she admitted
at the ""climic""?
-She was a regular visitor.
-I didn't know.
-I've told you about the abortions.
-What did she do at the ""climic""?
She had her hair done!
An abortion, of course!
Go on, laugh!
She had 5 abortions.
At 17, 19...
Then we broke up...
But we got back together
at her birthday...
She had her 3rd at 20, yes...
And the 4th at 28...
That's weird... He's all swollen up
but for his Johnny!
Dear, I love your little Johnny!
He's the man!
Then, she had
her symphysis operated.
Couldn't she see
you didn't want a child?
She didn't want one, not me!
I've always wanted a child...
...even now, that I'm 40.
-Now, stick to the symphysis.
I want a child from you.
Really?
You've never told me that.
-Will you let me speak?
-In front of Hilda?
It's ok,
we made peace with Germany.
Did you have to tell me now
that you're dying?
That way,
you'll always remember him.
Am I dying?
Guys, I'm not feeling really well.
No, I was joking, you wimp.
I'm not a wimp!
Haris, vhy don't you tell us
about Vasso and the ""climic"".
Give me a break.
""Climic"" and crap!
The clinic echoed with her shouts.
She's really difficult.
She was cursing and hitting me.
I relaxed when they took her in.
I dare say that during the operation,
I thought that if she died...
...I would finally find peace
of mind. Can you believe it?
And I'm with her since
we were teenagers.
I thought she had
to die to be free.
I waited 20 days...
Take the cap...
...and I wanted to ask
for a divorce.
But then...
-Then...
Then, nothing.
Nothing. Nothing, indeed.
How do you know?
-I am a psychic!
You know how many times
I said to myself 'Divorce her'?
-That's the problem.
-What?
That you're an introvert!
You don't open up to your wife.
See, she thinks you love her!
- You think I don't love her?
-Are you asking me?
-Why not?
Why don't you ask Hilda?
I'm emotional, I might say
something silly.
-Don't I love Vasso?
-Can't you see...
...that you are making
a fool of yourself?
Why don't you get lost? Bitches!
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't confide in you.
Confide in Vasso for a change.
Where the hell is she?
Did you wonder
if she loves you back?
Of course!
She forgot the cortisone.
How could she forget it?
She's really inconsiderate.
Then why doesn't she
divorce you?
She's afraid that I might
be happy without her.
-Aren't you afraid of that as well?
-Be afraid of my happiness?
I mean, you're afraid
she'll also be happy without you.
That she'll think she wasted her years
and should have divorced earlier.
All these can happen only
if she falls in love with someone.
A woman in love will do
whatever it takes.
-Don't be 20 sure of that.
-I am! Men are different.
They meet their responsibilities.
Stop laughing, stop it now!
Let me rephrase.
Say, I'm a ship-owner
and I love my yacht.
I won't wreck my other ships
because of that. It's a crime.
I would destroy so many people.
- Hail Captain Haris!
I'm glad he didn't shout ""ahoy""
when we first screwed.
Enough, ""Vasso I""
sails back to harbor.
I did my best, I reached
the yellow buoy we saw earlier.
-You managed to swim that far?
-Yes, I'm beat.
Well? Was there
any signal or just crap?
-Just crap...
-I knew it!
To make it worse,
I got so exhausted...
...that I plunged
the cell phone in the sea.
It's useless now...
-You think it matters?
My death is a minor detail?
- I'll remove the SIM card.
There's no signal, I said!
Sweet Mary Jesus!
Yes, of course... We may
have access to her operator.
Indeed... Although I doubt it.
Give-me-your-cell-phone. . .
To-have-a-go-with-it-as-well .
Vasso, you're spelling in Greek
to a German deaf-mute?
Vazo, I'll go.
You're tired.
-No!
-Vhy don't you let me?
I'll go just because...
it's got to be me.
Do you want to wreck
all of our cell phones?
I know how to do it now,
I thought about it as I swam back.
-You're just like your mother!
-Stop nagging, it's simple.
The band will hold the phone,
I'll swim with both hands...
...and I'll stop
to check for signal.
-Vhy can't I go then?
-I said no!
That's weird...
She left as soon as she came.
See, Haris? She's doing
everything to help you.
The itching's back?
-My future seems really dark.
-You stayed under the sun too long.
-Where are you taking me?
I don't believe it...
Come on... The sun'II
come out tomorrow!
Stop scratching.
-I can't help it!
Stop it, I said!
The ZIM card's not wet.
Maybe I can save the phone, too.
She saves the phone
from drowning...
...and I'm doomed
by a grouchy bee!
My cell phone had signal,
I saw it on our way here.
She's get help.
-You're sure ?
Yes! There was signal
even after the buoy.
Manolis will come to pick us up.
-Cross my fingers.
Look at this! I'm just like
the ""Dude"" Lebowski!
-Are you ok?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah...
-I'm going for a swim.
-Vait for me.
Vait up!
Inconsiderate cows!
Haris, are you stating
the real facts?
It's a bit difficult...
See, the facts cannot be altered.
People just experience
the truth from different aspects.
Someone can be two people.
Or, two people can be one...
Laurel and Hardy,
in the package of one!
-When did this begin?
-Many years ago...
But I didn't know it...
...because they never
both surfaced at the same time.
But during these critical moments
following the bee sting...
...the truth is that
we both shared the same stage.
Gotcha!
-Are you still feeling itchy?
-Yes, but do enjoy yourselves!
I don't want
to spoil your vacation!
Don't get angry,
we needed to refresh a bit.
We must keep calm.
You shrouded me
and went for a swim.
Even nurses in morgues
are more sensitive.
Haris, relax.
The bee did you wrong, not us.
Next time you see me eat honey...
...don't show pity.
Isn't it unfair?
We were 4 and the bee stung
the only one who's allergic!
Nature cannot be unfair.
Don't take it personally.
A bee stung you,
that's it! The end!
And then I flared up
and died, the end!
Don't cry in my burial.
Don't take it personally.
-Haris, you von't die.
-You swear?
I swear to you,
my snicker doodle.
-You don't count.
-Why?
-Because you have idolized me.
-Her medical skills don't count?
Not at all. Which doctor says,
""I swear, my snicker doodle""?
You fool, by now you'd be dead
from shock or suffocation.
What about the swelling?
Result of vascular dilation due to
histamine release in the blood.
You don't even
know the basics!
- You mean, I'll live?
- Yes!
Really?
-Why didn't you tell me?
-'Cause I was deaf-mute.
And now ""she speaks""?
She's about to go on mute
again because Willy's back.
Well? Did you regain signal?
I did...
50? Will they pick up
the Little Drummer Boy?
I don't think so...
But why?
With whom did you talk to?
With no-one.
Then what about that damn signal?
-Vasso, what happened?
-Vhat's wrong?
I see...
I'll die here...
Serves you right!
For what you did to me.
You're dead for me.
-What did I do?
- Why do you have to die?
- Relax, I'm not dead yet.
I didn't mean it...
It happened by mistake...
What happened, what?
I dialled 112
to save you, my love.
I mistakenly dialled 122...
...the answering machine
was activated and I heard you...
...in her messages. You talked
to her like it was me.
I was so stupid to ask
if you were talking to me...
Vasso, I love you.
You're the only one I love.
You don't love me...
Why don't you love me anymore?
You don't love me...
Why don't you love me anymore?
Who told you I don't love you?
Who told you that?
Tell me you were pretending...
Right? Tell me!
You're not feeling well?
-Maria, now what?
-Her name is not Petra?
If his pressure drops, we loose him.
You're the Manson's family!
Stop it, you weasel!
""Psychiatrist for deaf-mutes"".
Calm down. Now, the only thing
that matterz iz Haris.
Then, you can talk
everything through.
Maria is truly a doctor.
Anyway, she was a brilliant
Marlee Matlin!
""Co-smo-te"" and crap! You
should be ashamed of yourselves.
That's a whole different story.
Now, Haris comes first.
-She dares to talk back!
-Shut up 'cause you'll regret it.
Will you punch me?
Should I be afraid of a pothead?
-Tell her to shut up.
-No, you shut it!
Like you did these past days.
Your mouth I mean...
...because you had
everything else wide open!
Will you stop? You heard
my messages ""by mistake"", you say.
It was truly a mistake.
I dialled 122 instead of 112.
-Why did you call 112?
-The indication was only for 112.
Then, you would
have called only 112!
You couldn't dial 122.
Save this shit for someone else.
You only cared about my messages!
Where's my phone?
I threw it away, of course...
Men are real suckers.
They fall for one tear.
We knew it all and lurked
for your performance.
And you dared call me
Marlee Matlin!
How nosey! Nosey Parker!
This man's dying
and you want to finish him.
Is he gets hurt,
I'll report you to the cops!
Are you talking to compensate
your 3 days of silence?
What will you be
for the cops, Petra or Maria?
Haris, how are you feeling?
I feel dizzy, you guys...
Really dizzy...
What time is it?
Is Manolis here yet?
He's not here yet but...
He's coming any minute now...
How are you feeling?
-Weird...
-Do you realise you fainted?
-Who?
Me?
When did I faint?
Haris, what's up with you?
I don't feel all that good.
I don't feel all that good.
""Night had fallen...""
""and the moon had risen
and flooded with light the sea.""
""We moved to the rock,
expecting Manolis.""
""I was surrounded
by my most cherished ones.""
""However, never before have
I felt so deep into my skin...""
""...the utmost loneliness.""
Leave that part, it's nonsense.
True loneliness is
when no-one notices you.
But everybody was into me.
Vasso was involved and
she would find out about it.
But where was this fat dude
hiding all these years?
The truth is...
That I've never been well.
I met Maria for a reason.
I wanted to get therapy.
I could feel the fat guy coming.
I felt him ever
since I was little.
Maria says he represents
the suppressed anger for my father.
How silly! My father
was like all other dads.
My mother indeed
got angry at him...
...because he went to Germany
to ""bring back our money"".
As if he had forgotten it
somewhere in Dusseldorf...
...and went back to get it.
He stayed there 3 years.
I guess he worked for 'Siemens'...
...because he sent a refrigerator.
Cutting-edge technology.
Dad couldn't be
away from his family...
...so he started
a new one there.
Families became two
but the salary was still one.
Then, Siemens down sized...
Yet, my dad was optimistic...
...and told his German family
he'd bring their money from Greece.
We were so happy!
""Dad came back!""
In Germany, they were sad.
""Dad's gone"".
His stress caused him asthma.
He was torn between
Germany and Greece.
He always felt
he was at the wrong place.
He found peace
only in Zagreb.
He stopped there every 2 years
and had 30 minutes to himself.
When did you meet Hildegard?
On August '83, in Korinthos...
During summer...
...dad wanted
to be around all of us.
So, he brought
the Germans to Loutraki.
His leave was 1 month,
but nobody knew.
He was a train driver.
Every second night...
...he slept away from home.
He had bought a motorbike...
...and commuted
from Loutraki to Athens.
Until the day
he had an accident.
At the hospital,
they notified both families.
That's how I met Hilda,
who cried for her dad...
...who was mine as well.
I had no time to grief his death.
In a flash, I became a guardian.
Besides my mother, I had
to protect my little sister...
...who came into my life
as a ""latent love at first sight"".
One year later, I took her
to Kithnos on a holiday.
I met Vasso there,
we hooked up...
...and there was real drama!
My little Hilda
turned into a woman.
She got drunk on beer
and sang German songs.
Ever since, we have spent
all our 20 summers together.
During winter,
Hilda lives in Dusseldorf.
That's how I became a writer.
20 years of corresponding!
We beat even Tolstoy's
volume of writing!
At first, she didn't speak Greek
and had my letters translated.
That was one deep love...
She picked my best letters and
published them under the title...
...""Meine Liebe Schwester"",
dear little sister.
I became famous in Germany
before I knew it!
This is too much even
for someone down-to-earth.
After my 3rd discourse
as a writer...
...I concluded that
anyone can be an artist.
You just need to expose yourself
to the public with audacity.
-You need to be talented, however...
-No, just fearless.
Or really-really scared.
Fearless and scared people
have a common ground.
The same weird behaviour.
In your book, you say
you became two people.
It's not only you.
-The others saw just one person.
They saw one confused person.
But I knew I had company.
Maria says I want to complete
my dad's unfinished job.
To have it both ways.
I refuse to decide and
this keeps popping in front of me.
The man I'm seeing
represents my problem.
All men carry a burden...
...for me, it had to be
a fat guy! It's cool.
Is Manolis here?
Let's go on board!
I've got bad news.
It's 9:30 and still no sign of him.
Why did you let me sleep?
Me? You forgot
we both fainted?
Reason comes first
and then, panic prevails.
-You know we're dying?
-Yes, big loss for humanity.
I don't want to die,
I love my life.
Don't panic, but you must
start loving death, too.
It's decided, then?
I'm going to Hell?
Yeah! Life has been
a real Paradise, right?
You should pray to go to Hell.
In Heaven, girls are serious.
Good, I get wild
only with ass-shaking.
Did Maria do any ass-shaking?
You went to her for therapy.
She'll lose her job
if this comes out.
You went there
for therapy, not me!
You wanted to get rid of me.
You shouldn't lie to me.
There's just the two of me!
I admit it.
I wanted to get rid of you.
I won't ask you why. But
I never wished the same for you.
I must say that you did
really good work with Maria.
At first, I couldn't even
come through the door.
When you had
the perfect stage set...
...I'm sure you performed
the ""snicker doodle show"".
What? I ""performed
the snicker doodle""?
-Don't deny it.
-Why was it me?
It couldn't be me.
I was not there.
The only time I came,
I saw you kissing.
I heard her saying, ""I want us
to marry, snicker doodle"".
And then you freaked out
and left me to finish the job.
You think I've forgotten?
-I do love Maria.
-Then you should marry her.
Of course I would,
if I could get rid of you.
What's your problem with me?
Why do you want me to die?
Don't cry!
I'm tired of feeling
sorry for myself!
You're obsolete and
you drag me down, understand?
Vasso knows everything,
happy now? Look at her.
She's sleeping
for the past 2 hours.
You think she's dead?
Dead and crap.
How can she sleep?
She's escaping reality that way.
She's sleeping because
nothing is going to change.
But she's not the one
who tries to escape reality.
I wonder what you see
in that pothead...
When I met her, she didn't smoke
or drink, she had her patients...
By the way, the world's
full of crazy people.
-Indeed...
-Things are worse.
In the old days,
there was ""the village idiot"".
Now, it's ""the apartment idiot"".
Anyway...
-How do you know all this?
-The whole building visited Maria.
They went
with their slippers on...
Had I not known
she were a psychiatrist...
...I'd take her
for the janitor!
That's why
she fell in love with me.
'Cause I lived in another building.
I was like an exotic beauty.
Why did we fall in love with her?
Because she's like a baby.
Right, Rosemary's baby.
She thought
she had all the answers.
She was really good
with her patients.
But she knew nothing
about herself.
She was vulnerable
from day one.
And 1, instead of saving myself,
I found a partner in crime.
That's why I love her, you see...
-Love of my life, you're up?
-Yes, for some time now.
-What are you doing all alone?
-I'm thinking.
I talk to myself.
What you two talk about?
You want me to join you?
- She's joking with us!
- Well, snicker doodle?
Hello, snicker doodle!
Why isn't Manolis here yet?
-Why isn't Manolis here yet?
-I don't know...
I'm thirsty.
-I'm thirsty.
-Me too. Has the itching stopped?
Shit! Did she have to remind me?
Yes, it stopped completely.
-Did you get some sleep?
-No, only Vasso slept.
Me and Hilda stayed up.
-What is she doing?
-She's making wishes for 2 hours now.
She sees shooting stars
and goes...
Did you make a wish?
-I did.
-What did you wish for?
-If I tell you, it won't come true.
-Right, don't push our luck.
Wishing's all we got.
- What did you wish for?
- I'll tell you when it comes true.
-If it doesn't, you won't tell me?
-No, 'cause you'll be dead!
If it doesn't come true...
...I'll wait 'til it comes true.
I'm thirsty.
-We've run out of water?
-There is some left.
It's for Vasso, she vomited
and she'll dehydrate.
What did I do
to that poor woman?
-Why did she throw up?
-I don't know. Who knows?
-What's up?
-Same old...
We're watching the fireworks
of my closure ceremony.
-How are you feeling?
-Like a zeppelin ready for take off.
-You seem fine.
-That swelling's just muscle tone!
-Feel like joking?
-Why not, everybody's great!
-Vazo, how do you feel?
-How can she feel...
-I feel sick.
-We noticed that.
-Something made you sick.
-What did you eat?
Mackerels! Both yesterday
and the day before!
Will you shut up, you dick?
-Excuse me?
-She's right.
-Why?
-Do you want me to recap?
When she swam to get help,
she understood you have an affair.
Then, the mute talked back to her.
Vasso is not that stupid.
-I try to play it down, ok?
-What, the affair you mean?
She came back
to different people!
-What should I do, then?
-Shut up.
You can have the mute's part.
A mute is a must at this beach!
Do you want some water?
Maï¬a saved some for you.
Drink up, it will do you good.
I don't know
what's wrong with me.
I want to sleep.
On the other hand,
I'll sleep forever!
Let her sleep...
Here, sit! Sit!
-We could make a fire.
-With our sunscreens?
-Yes, we got no wood.
-It's getting serious.
It's strange Manolis
didn't show up.
Remind me
to give him a beating.
Something must have happened.
Even if he forgot, his mum vouId
notice us missing at the taverna.
Even so, everybody
knows we came here.
They would have sent
someone for us.
-I can't breath.
-You're stressed, forget it.
-I don't think it's Manolis' fault.
-Oh, really?
If only we had some water...
Are you hungry?
Yes, but we don't make a fuss
because we're thirsty.
Damn South wind...
No, the wind comes
from the North.
As I vatched Ursa Minor...
...a cloud of smoke
from the North covered it.
-Was it really Ursa Minor?
-Of course, Ursa Major is right here!
-How about the wind?
-The North star was my guide.
-You didn't say that before.
-At least, I think so.
Anyway, we're near
The Etesian winds season.
And these come
from the North?
Etesian winds refresh
Zahara desert!
I'll kill myself, before I die,
I'll kill myself.
Marlene Dietrich revive!
Hey, hey!
If we'd put a message in a bottle
and throw it in the sea...
...it would reach the village, right?
-It would, yes.
But it would reach it
after our funeral...
What we'd write in it?
-We'd write...
""Manolakis, this isn't
what we arranged, is it?""
Could there be something
we are forgetting?
I'm thinking about going
to the yellow buoy.
Did you get an idea,
or are you just warming up?
I saved Vazo's cell phone,
it may just work!
But she told us
that it had no signal.
Well, that's true,
but it's worth trying.
Don't forget the hat.
-I've never swum in the moonlight.
-Thanks, but no.
It looks nice,
but in there it's dark...
...there are seaweed
and sharks!
God no! I can't even imagine
getting a cramp in there.
You've never let me
do all the things I like.
So what? You're just as well!
The mothers of cowards
never mourn.
To fly by aeroplane
and see the world from above...
As the song goes,
""people look like ants"".
People were always so close,
suffocating me.
-You suffocated them!
-No, you did!
You never say what you think
in fear of losing them!
Now, you're here with them
and they're stuck in your own mess.
What are you
thinking about, darling?
I'm considering
all aspects of the situation.
-And what's your conclusion?
-There's no conclusion.
The fat guy is here again?
No, no.
Yes...
Since morning,
he's never stayed that long.
-Let him be, it's ok.
-See? She likes me!
-What?
-He thinks you like him.
I like him alright!
Up yours, asshole!
Who said he wanted
to have a baby with me?
He did!
Good! Let him come
so we can have it!
-Up yours now, asshole!
-Promises are made to be broken.
-Well?
-The wimp takes it back.
-I'm not a wimp!
-His promise was just a reaction.
You asked me
what did I wish for, right?
Come closer
so that I can tell you.
Your parents and teachers
did a brilliant job!
Come on, guys!
You, morons!
That's more like it!
Find us a way out, we're gonna die,
don't you see?
Guys, you're driving me
nuts here!
I will wake Vasso up.
-He will wake Vasso up!
-He's too wimpy to do it.
-I'm not a wimp!
I did find myself
when I thought my end was near.
The following day,
I wouldn't be alive.
All I could do,
was to propagate the species.
Not out of respect.
Just for Maria.
She seemed to know something
I couldn't grasp.
Something she craved
with all her female nature.
A child.
-They sleep hugging each other now?
-Why, does it bother you?
At this point, I don't know
what bothers me anymore.
How are you feeling?
Be a little patient.
There was a fire at the village,
that's why Manolis didn't come.
A fire?
You're a liar!
-It must have been bad.
-How do you know that?
I fixed your cell phone,
I talked to Manolis.
He's alright, don't worry.
Stupid Manolis!
What fire, what did it burn?
I don't know,
he apologised for not showing up.
I told him Haris needs a doctor
and he said he's on his way.
-Good. Did you regain signal?
-Yes.
At the buoy.
Where you regained
signal as well.
I didn't!
""At the same time, 2 miles away
from the isle, at the village...""
""...another story was unfolding,
at the side of our adventure.""
""However, only later did I find out
about these following events.""
""I cite them because
it is interesting to approach...""
""..the secret, parallel universe
of the female psyche.""
How are you feeling?
Here we go again...
As if you care about me.
You might already know
that you're pregnant.
The vomiting, the drowsiness,
your breasts are swollen.
-You told her about me!
-No, I swear!
-You knew?
-You've plotted the two of you!
I told you, I said nothing!
But now, you should talk.
I have nothing to say!
It's a miracle to have a baby
after all you've been through.
I'm talking to you as a doctor.
As a woman, I hate you're having
Haris' baby, but that's another issue.
Talk to her now
or I'll do it myself.
I won't answer for what
I do with my husband to her!
- With whom?
- Hilda, shut up!
You, shut up!
I guess you don't want
to wake Haris up.
So, it's gonna be you
or it's gonna be me?
Do whatever you please!
What was this all about?
She's not having Haris' baby...
What?
It's Manolis'...
Manolis who?
Manolis...
Who brought us here...
-He's only a child!
-He's a man now.
He was a child
when they hooked up.
Hilda, what are you saying?
Before you started seeing Haris,
Vasso had an affair with Manolis.
-How do you know that?
-Vazo told me.
-""Vhy"" did she tell you?
-Because...
...if I knew, I wouldn't be
a threat anymore, see?
A threat?
Yes... For what she thought...
I don't understand a thing.
She thought I might
hook up with Manolis.
Yeah, right!
He's only a child!
Will you stop
calling him a child?
What fool is a 18 year old man!
-Why do you call him a fool?
Because he won't
give in to you?
-You're hitting on him as well?
-Don't listen to her!
She lost her mind over that boy.
I lost my mind? You're dying
to teach him German!
You taught him algebra,
she'll teach him German...
He'll become Einstein!
- He asked, I couldn't refuse.
And I pretended to be mute...
What's done, is done. My affair
doesn't redeem your sins.
But your affair
makes you a murderer.
It makes me a murderer?
When you first went for help,
you regained the signal.
You called Manolis
and told him not to come!
-Who told you that, Manolis?
-I saw your calls.
You dared tell us
there was no signal.
Manolis also left you a message
you haven't taken.
You listen to other
people's messages now?
That makes two of you.
So, what did he say?
""Love, I hope you know
what you're doing...""
""...but you must find me
an excuse for my delay.""
What you and Manolis are up to?
Killing Haris? Are you nuts?
As if! Nothing can hurt Haris!
Last year, he took
his cortisone and was fine.
I just needed some time
and I asked Manolis to be late.
I wanted to put an end
to this circus today.
-You knew about me and Haris?
-I said nothing, cross my heart!
I could tell he had an affair.
Then, I saw how he looked at you.
That's why I took your cell phone.
I needed evidence to finish it.
Won't you tell him
about Manolis?
I want him to think we separated
'cause he fell in love.
Haris wouldn't stand rejection
for a 18 year old boy!
My Haris is like a child...
And Manolis, a real man!
I was like a mother
to him, like a sister...
Hilda and Haris, the two orphans...
That's why I didn't have a child.
Want me to believe it's my fault
you're cheating on Haris?
Nobody can stand guilt.
That's why you did all that today.
Haris thought you'd die
if you found out about us.
Your truth will set him free.
If he finds out, he'll go crazy.
When I'll be at the delivery room...
...he'll visit me
from the psychiatric ward.
I think...
...you must call Manolis
to come and pick us up.
I've already called him.
If it was up to Vazo...
...she would have
the baby right here!
Manolis! Over here!
Here, boy!
Manolis, you won't believe it!
Girls, hurry! Manolis is here!
Don't laugh! Stop it, you cows!
Manolis, don't be scared, it's me.
I got stung by a bee
and swelled up.
I look like Marlon Brando.
Soon, I'd be also dead like he is!
-We should take the umbrellas.
-Umbrellas my foot! Tomorrow.
I won't die here. Move!
You won't believe
what we've been through.
Look at Manolis.
He's a real man now.
Girls, sit down.
See for yourselves,
he's a true pro.
Let's go...
Guys, we're saved!
""Before setting foot
on the village...""
""...the smell of fire that by then
was under control...""
""...justified instantly
Manolis' delay.""
""The fire had started
from his father's taverna...""
""...and spread
to the esplanade shops.""
""It was a great disaster.""
""Manolis fell into contradictions
which showed he was still a child.""
""However, I owe him to say that
Manolis was equal to his deed.""
""He took full responsibility
and Vasso wasn't charged...""
""...with accessory before the fact
of a capital offence.""
""He never mentioned
his fatal passion...""
""....nor sought excuse by blaming
the woman who had trapped him!""
The end.
Your honor, I wish you
to allow me call to the stand...
...the most important witness
for Manolis Zambakos, my client.
She's important
to this case because...
...she encouraged Haris
to write the truth!
Had Haris not known
what happened...
...this case would have closed
as another mistrial.
I call Maria Giannakoudakis!
What we learned today
is it fiction or plain reality?
It's the whole truth.
Why did you tell Haris
what had happened?
It did him good, you think?
Depends on how you see it.
Your client
burned down a village...
...I pretended to be mute,
Hilda to be blind, for what?
To sustain Vasso and Haris' lie.
You sound irritated.
I sound tired.
I want Manolis out of prison.
And Vasso just became a mother...
...and I'm next in line!
She wasn't the arsonist
nor told him to set the fire.
Manolis's act was free of malice.
-So you mean...
...there should be
more people in prison...
...or none at all.
Since your client
took full responsibility...
...he wouldn't be pleased
with more imprisonments.
He could have done it without you!
We need to lighten his position.
You have a better way than this?
I can only speak to you
as I soon will to my son.
I'll tell him, ""For you to be born,
a bee had to sting your dad...""
""...he had to be really scared
and a village to burn down.""
""All that, because of you.""
Chaos theory.
A bee burns down a village.
This surely will set Manolis free.
Are you serious?
And the peoples' fortune
that were lost?
Nobody had to pay for it?
I would tell my son that the bee
after completing its duty....
...died living behind its sting.
The little boatman,
after burning down the village...
...went to prison
to serve his penalty.
And your dad, after being scared,
got free with your coming.
-You are optimistic.
-Yes!
You think Haris will come around
regarding your baby.
That's only up to him.
And Haris will do it!
As he did it that night.
He will do it once more.
Why are we here?
It's February.
You don't like it?
It's nice but perhaps
we could go skiing...
-I feel warm.
-Me, I'm really cold.
- I'm sweaty.
- Incompatibility of temper!
Great incompatibility, indeed.
Can't get any worse.
You're overreacting.
Just because I'm cold?
I am starting to feel warm now.
-Let's swim, then.
-No way.
You promised we wouldn't swim.
Promises are made to be broken.
When will they come
to pick us up?
Normally...
...at the crack of dawn.
What do you mean ""normally""?
It means, unless we swim back...
Why are you acting like an ass?
Great, he's brought butter, too!
Look... I'll try to swim
in the moonlight.
If you want to...
...you can stay here.
- You'll freeze! Or drown!
But if I do it?
You'll be decorated?
Where are you going?
I'm going back to Maria.
You'll never make it back alive.
Dead or alive...
...I'm going back to Maria.
Haris, please, don't go...
If they see you, they'll think
I came with you and won't pick me up.
Haris, you can't leave me behind.
Behind me!
That's where you belong.
Behind me!
Haris, help me!
Forward!
Forward!"
19,A Belfast Story (2013) - full transcript,"In a city left torn by war, when a series of murders awaken dormant memories, many fear the worst. Colm Meaney (""Hell On Wheels"", ""Layer Cake"", ""Con Air"") and Malcolm Sinclair (""Casino Royale"", ""V for Vendetta"") star in a film set between war and peace. Times are changing, car bombs are less common and terrorists find themselves out of work, but old habits die hard. And while most go quietly into the night, one man must find the few who won't comply. A greying assassin has stopped walking his son to school. With motives buried deep in the Irish conflict, everyone is about to discover that the past matters to someone...","UFF? Easy going,
they only killed 50 people.
He was finished.
To do that in LVF territory...
You mean by a fecking...
You know I hate balmy wars.
Now he's attacked
by UDA men.
Heavens, EvF came for
them and that was that, sort of.
The ARB's dead and gone.
And then he was red hot
and on the run underground.
I don't know the provost.
- You have the whole story.
- Rid IRA?
You're nuts. They don't
know how to make a bomb.
A poet told a story
of a boy walking under ice,
shooting a man
as he ate his breakfast,
an ulster fry.
Then he turned to his wife
and said:
""Sorry, Mum.""
To understand Northern Ireland,
you have to realize
a strange war was fought here.
There were no heroes,
no defining battles.
Only casualties.
People die defending
their daily lives,
not always their causes.
The trouble with The Troubles
is you can't put a border
between neighbors.
Then the story was told again.
This time better.
They flew in in jets,
talked up a ceasefire
and told us
that it was all over now.
The past is in the past.
Let it sleep.
This is Belfast,
and this is a Belfast story.
Lost years.
And it still echoes.
Right this way, sir.
Chief Constable wanted
to brief you personally,
about the scene.
Mistake dug this house
years ago.
So many cold rainy nights.
Always. Always raining.
This way, sir.
Ah, James.
- So glad you could make it.
- Mm.
Come inside.
- You too, um...
- Damien, sir.
What we have here
is a gruesome motiveless murder
of an old pensioner,
to make matters worse.
Pardon, sir,
but this address has history.
Well, yes, a connection
was never proven
so we'll have to leave that.
We wouldn't want
to start the press
on political bias again,
would we?
And the important thing
is you apply
all your undoubted skills
to find the killer
and dealing with any
of the intricacies
this case may present.
Now I see why I've been
plucked off the scrap heap.
The problem has raised
it's ugly head, eh?
And the motives go way back.
Deep.
And that got said, you need
someone for damage control.
Someone is about
to disappear anyway.
Someone about to retire.
Someone like me.
You know what your problem is,
James?
You have exactly the wrong kind
of intelligence.
You're too clever
just to take orders.
You have to look behind them.
But then you're not smart enough
to benefit from your knowledge.
No wonder you're the last
of your stubborn kind.
Still, I know you'll do
a splendid job.
Show us around then, Damien.
Body was found upstairs.
And neighbors reported
an explosion
at approximately 4 a.m.
It was in an empty room on
a chair surrounded by needles.
Messy.
Very messy.
I'll find him.
Show James the lead, Damien.
In the unused bedroom,
a great deal of money
was found and a note.
And it read,
""Official receipt for expenses.
Two-hundred and fifty thousand
pounds removed
from known criminal revenue.""
And scrawled below it
was the word justice.
Did you count the rest?
Five hundred thousand pounds
remain.
Well, you can add that
to your sob story then.
They took a third
of his pension.
I'm gonna leave you
to get on with your work, James.
I'm assigning Damien here
to assist you
with any leg work
or paper filing.
Any resources you need,
consider them yours.
I have to be away.
I have a small speech
to prepare.
There was two of them.
How do you know?
A lot of nails
to carry up the stairs
and one of them had to watch
your man
while the other dug
the money out.
Could that have
been done afterwards?
After the explosion?
You don't hang around
after a bang like that.
They crouched in the garden,
waiting for something.
My guess is
the old man got up bright
and early.
They were waiting for a light.
What makes you think
he was awake when they came?
The bed sheets weren't ruffled.
Nobody was dragged
out of that bed.
No.
They waited for a light
and they melted the bolt
and charged up the stairs.
Then what happened?
They tied him to the chair.
Tied?
Aye.
Why else would he have been
so close to the blast?
It also fits
the executionary style.
Near the nail bolt.
That was his weapon of choice
back in the day.
These boys were sending
a message.
After that, the money?
Aye.
One of them
would have stood over him,
while the other
went to look for the money.
What kind of justice is that?
This is Belfast.
Sir?
Are you coming?
I'm sorry, sir.
It's just that you need to know
there's been a murder.
I've just taken the call.
An elderly IRA veteran
was killed in his home.
It was a bomb.
Oh, not now.
The Chief Constable says
he'll sit on it
for as long as he can.
I just can't help him again.
We've suffered enough.
I thought you'd want to know
right away.
Of course.
We must reassure the people
that no matter what
the consequence,
we are not going backwards.
I'm building on a foundation
of peace.
But it will crumble quickly.
I'll begin drafting right away.
You want me to have Eammon
take a look?
Aye. You better.
I know this is a lot
of my own making.
- But I need time to change it.
- I know.
And we don't need old enemies
picking off old friends.
This could be worse.
This could be the start
of something new.
- I'm walking with the ghosts.
- Sir?
Every week, I come here
to face the ones
I failed to save.
Not your fault, sir.
It reminds me
of what's really important.
Not the battles,
not the politics.
The people.
You see, I count corpses,
not causes.
All I want
is a bright
new day in my city.
We're living in the shadows
of the past.
I know. Come on, sir,
we're not going back there.
And, sir, listen.
It wouldn't surprise me
if the IRA deal with us
before we get a chance to.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Another war.
Get in, will you?
Well, as you can see,
I stopped walking my son
to school.
It's a dangerous world
out there.
I saw him once.
He was coming out the court
out of the amnesty.
I was on the beat,
holding back
the victim's relatives.
Never seen such contempt
read large in someone's face.
So someone
is definitely hunting down
ex-IRA men.
Aye. Unh!
Someone with a grievance.
And a sense of irony.
You sound as if you think
something like this
could be justified.
Vigilantes can never
be justified.
You're a man of old principle.
Just a man of principle.
Not too many of them around,
that's all.
So it's been a while since
you've come looking for me.
Must be needing something done.
Aye. You've heard about
the killings?
Who hasn't?
Except those that don't matter.
What do you reckon?
Could be nothing,
could be a paramilitary shade.
One death in this city
is either unnoticed
or the start
of some shit storm.
Anyway, you didn't come here
for my political assessment.
- What do you want?
- I want you to look around.
Check out the usual agents.
Warn them off
or just tell youse all about it?
Just call in, Eammon.
We're in a different business
these days.
The end of the alley from
hereabouts, one of these houses.
They never would've ventured
further that way.
They knew someone in here.
Now, how could you
be knowing that?
It's just to see them
all the way along the street.
Remember the makeshift
barricades were just down there.
It took the army two years
to work up the nerve
to move them.
Mm. That side, nothing.
Three yards this way?
Eammon and his friends
are pelting you
with Molotov cocktails.
Shall we go house to house then,
question the residents?
Well, enjoy. You'll get there.
At least I know
what's already here.
Oh, they look after their own.
Or try.
They knew his escape route.
What does that tell you?
What does that tell me?
It tells me
that someone's cleaning house.
And are bloody good at it.
But they'll make a mistake.
Angry people always do.
Anything I can do for you, sir?
I thought we might have
a quick word.
Better handle them formally.
Oh, and I appreciate you
calling my office
about the unpleasantness.
It's always good to hear about
these things early in the day.
Of course, sir.
We mustn't let things
get out of hand.
We're sculpting hope from ashes.
It's a delicate process
that can bear no interruption.
I've chosen the best man
for the job.
He'll see it through.
Discretion?
Personified.
You must explain to the world
that Northern Ireland will not
descend into violence again.
You won us this peace
and we'll maintain it.
These are your people.
They're hunting you, Colum.
They're gonna kill you.
Colleen, love,
we've discussed this.
Those people who died
have retired.
They had no protection.
I've kept this in case this
sort of thing ever happened.
And I've contacts keeping
an eye out for us.
They won't get me.
Colleen?
I'm going in to work
with Kelly, love.
When I'm gone,
call the police.
Tell them you thought you heard
someone tampering with the car.
And then take Marian
and get a taxi to your sisters.
Kelly? Yeah, it's me.
I need a spin.
Right now, yeah?
They think they're so smart,
these boys.
Reckon that I would drive my car
without checking it proper?
It's not that easy.
You know, if it were me against
some sophisticated target,
I would've gone for a roadside.
If it was me,
I'll never go near a car again.
Then you never think
it will be you.
I can't have it.
The press are going wild.
I want this bloody mess
cleared up.
And I want an assurance
we are not going back there.
Not on my watch.
Sir, it's difficult to discern
a clear pattern.
Especially without laying
the blame on loyalists
because all the victims
were ex-IRA.
That isn't good enough.
I want these people caught.
Now I think you have a theory,
James.
You tell me.
We're talking internment
conditions, remember them?
I will take anyone
off the street,
evidence to follow later.
That is not gonna work
and you know it.
Just find my man.
- Give me my peace back.
- Ugh.
I've spent half my life
cleaning up bloody messes.
Some coming in for causes,
some for revenge, some for fun.
I know these people.
I will find them.
All right, all right.
What have you got?
Well, the only pattern
we can see
is the victims are all IRA.
That would indicate
loyalist vengeance,
but they're not
even celebrating.
So that leaves us
with a highly motivated,
previously unknown force?
Uh, I still think
this is a private vendetta.
I just can't figure out
why they are targeting
the whole IRA.
Most people
have a specific grudge.
Well, if a specific grievance
cannot be found
then are we gonna assume
it's political?
I could be wrong.
Maybe somebody
is trying to restart the war.
- What then?
- God help us.
Where's your party?
Eammon.
Been a while.
What brings you back
to the E Street?
I'm thinking someone
might be crossing the water.
Can you see any young ones
making a move?
No. I still keep on watch.
Maybe a few years
since everyone went quiet
but I stand vigilant.
I didn't see anything.
Anything?
No. They've been staying
their side of tracks.
Haven't been over in force
in a while.
I would have raised the alarm.
Not a soul? Are you sure?
No. We keep watch.
Night and day as we do.
Carry on.
Aren't those nice jacket, Mitt?
Aye, too nice
for an old shite like yourself.
Ah, bloody peace.
This city used to be too hard
for the likes of them.
It won't start again, sir.
Hmm, no chance.
You think not.
I will see.
No. If it's possible.
I don't know.
I'll, uh...
I'll talk to you later.
Hi, Sinead.
You're still the only woman
who could hold my eye.
Sure, now, Owen.
You've always known
what you want.
And I was a close second.
Aah.
I have to think
of all the fun we had.
Oh, you've moved on,
and up I see.
But you're not going
to the politics game yourself.
Uh, the door is always open.
I have too much baggage.
And my life is better for it.
Why virus?
Why is it always our lot?
Revenge leads to revenge.
No one is ever happy
until they are grieving at you.
We need something new.
Not just the same
tired old thing.
Please, God...
Not always the same
tired old pattern.
For years, I chased
every agent with a bomb.
Orange or green?
Another force of the earth...
Sending me to deal with this.
A last whimper of The Troubles.
None of our arising stars
wanna be associated with that.
There's no change in the world
when what you want
is what you can't have.
But a piece would be nice.
No, that's not important.
I can't see beyond
the IRA connection.
So you bring in
the usual other suspects?
Nah.
They were never capable
of something like this
even at their height.
We need reinforcements too.
You'll protect the IRA boys
who might become targets.
Oh, and that...
Look into those wiretaps
I was talking to you about, hmm?
Aah.
I have to rush back
to the office, sir.
Somebody messed up
an application
for some case files.
I'm so sorry, sir.
I should be back,
won't take long.
How long have you got?
I said it was paperwork,
so not too long.
How is our old friend?
I'm keeping a close eye on him
as you said to.
Drop him off at night,
linger there just make sure
he doesn't go anywhere else.
He's with me from morning on.
And you're keeping a list
of everyone he talks to?
Every file he looks into?
Every piece of paper he signs?
Aye, sir.
He doesn't seem much interested
in paperwork, sir.
- I do most of it anyway.
- Good.
You understand, um,
this may all have
to go away very quickly?
Aye.
It will be easy done.
Stick terribly close to him.
I'm afraid he may find
those responsible
and then be so
overcome with morality,
he won't hand them
over to their, um, fate.
You'll have to step in
very quickly
if he shows any sign
of going native.
Why did you choose him, sir?
All of my connections are
generally with the other side.
He knows
the loyalist militias.
He's around when their informers
were managed.
He's in the same communities
as these avengers.
Not many left in the force,
that that can be said of.
And my sympathies
lie entirely with the new order.
No sense in mixing worlds.
It, um, complicates things.
Aye. What about himself?
Don't put him
through that again.
He'll be back in a minute.
Your man
is a million miles away.
Murders, past or present,
what do you reckon?
Makes no difference to James.
He knows
what all those lads did.
Or he thinks he does.
Don't knock the man.
He has a heart of gold.
Ah, he certainly has, but
what does he got to show for it?
You didn't know him
when he was young and fierce.
I remember one time,
the whole street exploded
and he still managed to clip
the heels of the guilty lad.
Aye, and inconclusive evidence.
They got their man off,
and he still got house bond
for his troubles.
The world is strange...
And to other news,
three elderly men from
different Belfast addresses
have all been reported missing.
All three had been tried
for offenses during The Troubles
but not convicted.
Among them is a prominent
Republican spokesman...
Ah, that's me away, lads.
I wonder whether he gets
his man this time.
- Well, here's to ""this time.""
- Here's to ""this time.""
It's a long way to come
looking for missing Belfast.
Aye, well...
We're looking for his spokesman.
This is where he did
his speaking.
Huh, shit.
Imagine being lectured on your
moral failings by a terrorist.
I'm sorry, Kevin.
Some people just don't know
when the war is over.
They will when I get hold
of them, yes, they will.
I'm haunted, Owen.
The past is too strong for me.
We need to come clean.
Be rid of it.
Past is the past. Let it sleep.
It's not sleeping,
it's consuming me.
Calm yourself.
You're safe with me.
You can't defend me
against my conscience.
You have a duty
to your former comrades as well.
They're here.
I think they're all dead.
Shit.
Of course they're here.
Of course they're dead.
Oh, these boys
know their history.
We have their message.
So this is where
they made the old farm?
Them and the Brits'
shoot-to-kill policy.
Aye.
You have a point.
Shoot to kill should never
have been the policy
of any civilized government.
Three more bodies.
It's an epidemic.
If it wasn't for the remoteness
of this godforsaken place,
we have the press here
all over us.
I know. I know.
There's something I'm missing.
- Unh.
- But I will find them.
You miss the point, James.
You speak as if we're operating
in a vacuum.
The fact that only
some sort of miracle
is preventing a general panic
has obviously alluded you.
That is not happening
because this time,
everybody knows
that those being killed
have blood in their hands.
Are they less entitled
to our protection then?
No.
But they maybe facing more
than we're able
to protect them from.
Fancy supper, please.
- Salt and vinegar?
- Yeah.
- Fish and chips.
- Salt and vinegar?
Cheers.
- Fish and chips.
- Salt and vinegar?
I'll have all.
Come on.
Where? Where was it?
Paddy. Paddy.
Paddy? I'm sorry.
Paddy.
It's just supposed to be
diamonds.
God help me.
I know you're so important
with your son.
But I'm glad
you met an early grave.
I will never forget
that little girl.
You remember
when they let you out of jail?
Thinking to myself...
If there's any justice
in the world...
...you will meet some fate.
It's too glamorous. Too obvious.
This is a decoy. Just a decoy.
These boys are building a forest
to hide a tree.
Come on.
About freaking time.
Listen, Owen,
the detective boys
are on to something.
Now I need to know
what it is
if you still want me
to find these lads.
Pardon me?
Sorry, love. Wrong number.
Tell your boss I called.
Prick.
It brings out the flavor,
which is essential
in a dish like this.
One of the things
people often ask me
is how they can obtain more
variety within the confines...
Now, you see...
What do you want?
Some of your old friends
are being killed.
And what's that
got to do with me?
I'm investigating the case.
I'm here to offer you
police protection.
Oh, with your consent,
of course.
Why would I take protection
off a lawless policeman
like yourself?
Truth be told,
your sympathies probably lie
with these lads killing people.
Go on celebrate
your last hurrah.
I am here to enforce
the law of the land.
Even if that means
protecting scum like you
from a fate you deserve.
You take your moral high ground,
years spent suppressing us
to preserve your way of life.
I went after anyone
who broke the law.
Both sides, yours and mine.
Let's talk about
one of yours for a minute, eh?
Murder expert.
Big man, killed a lot
of policemen in the barracks.
One day,
he needed some gelignite.
So he sent three young boys
to collect it for him.
Gelignite is not too stable.
Took half the building
with them.
All that was left
to show one poor father
was a tongue.
So we're both hard men.
I can drink to that.
It's easy to set a bomb.
It takes a hard man
to clean up afterwards.
The lights are lit.
Your monitor in the radio
says it will be over in 5.
Aye, he's not worth
missing something over.
All units, we have a shooting.
It appears fatal.
They're gonna kill me, Owen.
They know.
That's not gonna happen.
It's not life I fear for,
it's truth.
Oh, it's tragic, isn't it?
So senseless violence.
That was a world ago.
On a different time.
And the innocents?
Sometimes sacrifices
have to be made.
There's not a day goes by
I don't think
of those who lost their lives
in the cause or because of it.
And it's their memory
and legacy
that these modern day killers
directly attack.
Of course.
And to survive
such terrible things...
It's no wonder
you're so desperate
to lead us away from them.
Aye.
The irony is they only put up
those barriers
after his mortar attacks.
They spent years trying
to put a stop to his violence.
These boys come
and do it in a few seconds.
At great cost though, sir.
And also, if you can check...
This is not a good time.
Use the normal line.
You
haven't been answering yourself.
Have you gotten your squeeze?
It's tough at the top.
I'll call you later.
I have wanted to do this
for years.
I have been terrified that
someone would seek to harm me.
Now I...
I'm only scared that I might die
before I would get
to tell the truth.
I have bombed and killed.
And not a day goes by that
I do not pray for forgiveness.
I'm not sure anymore that you're
even trying to solve this thing.
Pardon?
An old shopkeeper
has been killed.
And just because
he was an IRA bomber,
you don't care.
Your politics are preventing you
from keeping the peace.
I lost everything I value.
My politics and my opinion
are the least of my sacrifices.
Who...?
My daughter.
She was everything to me.
I'm sorry. I didn't me...
I'll go for a little stroll.
I'll see you later.
You're home early, dear.
Aye. I needed a spot of lunch
and some time to think.
Is everything all right?
I don't know.
I always thought I knew
but maybe I never did.
You're tired, love.
You've been working too hard.
Aye.
I'll keep at it. Uh...
Sorry. I'll eat out after all.
You better get on.
Another pensioner and suspected
IRA pipe bomber killed.
Cause of death?
Heart attack.
Clever boys. Clever boys.
Oh, yeah.
They knew that he had built
so many of these in his day.
Just the sound of a detonator
would be enough to kill him.
What sort of sick person
would kill a man
due to die in days anyway?
I considered it myself
many times.
He took my daughter
and 12 others.
Rest in peace.
How are you holding up, big man?
I wanted to kill him.
So help me, I wanted to.
Yeah, but you didn't.
No.
A lot of good it did.
He's dead anyway.
- He's dead.
- I heard.
It's still not
bringing her back.
No.
She's been at peace for too long
to be troubled.
Why send me?
That was 20 years ago.
I must look to the future,
not always
to the tragedies of the past.
You represent Sarah Aaron
in my place.
Who invited her?
What are you doing here?
I'm representing Sarah Aaron,
trying to show respect
for your loss.
Feck off, will you?
Away with you!
You work for a murderer, fine.
But don't bring his flowers
to our loved one's graves.
Where the hell have you been?
Around. Same as you.
- Well?
- Not a thing.
Checking all the usuals.
You've never let me down before.
Why now?
Too much easy living?
You sound a little nervous,
big man.
Don't you worry.
These are still nice streets.
For old time's sake.
I'll find these clever wee lads
and finish them.
Fair winds, old friend.
Hello, sir.
How long do we know each other?
Uh, a long time, sir.
I can't believe we're here.
Do you know how many cases
that piss our ass like this one?
Aye, he always had a lawyer
and a gun handy.
It would be wanted here
this time. You mark my words.
We have here a warrant
to search Mr. Sullivan's home
in relation
to an ongoing investigation
about the deaths of several
prominent Republicans.
The Northern Ireland Police
Service has noted publicly
that your client is not
under suspicion in any way,
but rather we are acting
preemptively
out of concern for his safety.
My client welcomes your concern
but unfortunately,
he's across the border
in business at the moment.
- All right, just up there.
- Aye.
- Aye. Okay.
- One over here.
- All okay?
- It's fine.
What do you stand for?
What's upsetting you?
Seeing the pain you caused.
I always believed you,
your ideals.
The rest was just the past.
In war, things happen.
Terrible things.
I don't know what sad soul
told you there was.
But I stand before you
willing to make it right.
How can you?
When you won't accept
the consequences
of your own actions?
You're...
You're the problem.
That's true.
I've seen some terrible things.
But I am unique.
I connect the evilest of those
on our side with the means...
I built the consensus
that brought us peace.
And your continuing presence
destroys it.
You don't understand.
You're too young.
You don't remember the causes.
That's true.
So I don't have to let them mold
the future.
Yeah?
Where?
I got you, you bastards.
The past is the past.
Let it sleep.
- We're at peace, Damien.
- What kept you, sir?
I had some business
to attend to.
I thought I'd catch you for
a quiet word at the same time.
Anyway,
I just heard from the Big Man.
- Owen?
- Yeah.
He's concerned.
He says that South Ireland
doesn't have the resources
for taking action
on this sort of thing anymore.
He wants us to throw our weight
behind our Unionist detectives.
And, by any means possible,
put a stop to these killings.
But that's just
what we've been on.
It's worse.
He's admitting the UIR
can't handle these lads.
They've met their match
in the rough stuff department.
And are appealing to friends
they made in the police force.
He's made it clear he expects
these friends to deliver.
So, what's the problem?
We keep doing
what we've been doing, except...
No. Not exactly.
I didn't haul myself
out of the same gutter
Owen did before I played
into the hands of others.
It's a new dawn.
I should have smelled
it earlier.
So, what are we to do?
The IRA had become old men.
Cringing politicians
turned so legitimate
they can't defend
their own lies.
We mailed them.
But they're in no position
to call in a favor.
And, may never be again.
We help James.
Make it seem
we're pushing him through.
When he finds
this new force of his,
ha, ha, and he will,
we let them finish the job
that they started.
They get their revenge
and go home happy.
And as we embrace a new Belfast
without an IRA,
we shall be left
with those left standing.
Sacrament most holy,
sacrament divine,
all praise and all thanksgiving
be every moment thine.
Through him, with him, in him,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
all praise and honor are yours,
Almighty Father.
Forever and ever.
Sorry, lads, we're a bit lost.
Is there a petrol station
near here?
I knew you'd come.
But what does it matter now?
You've lost.
You're the last
of the loyalist scum.
And no one wants you.
You flatter yourselves like you
came up like innocent victims.
But you didn't.
You came
because you've lost your colony.
And now it's time for you
to go home.
But home
doesn't want you either.
You're the bastard sons
of a fallen empire.
With so much blood
on your hands,
you're just looking
for someone to blame.
Someone who resisted.
I'm one.
Do whatever you want to me,
you fuckers.
More will rise in my place,
we'll drive them to the sea.
You fucking Protestant loyalist.
Murderers.
Rapers of Irish sovereignty.
I'm a Catholic Irishman
from Newry.
I came about my family.
My father was
a good Nationalist.
He believed
in the United Irish Republic.
He was never a rich man.
He ran a small petrol station
near the border.
Then one day,
your folks came by to buy it
at a knocked down price.
They explained it was needed
for fund raising
as part of your IRA
smuggling empire.
My father replied
that it was his living.
And he couldn't support
my family without it.
Your lads were a little
more heavy-handed then
than they are today.
At the end of the month,
his mutilated body
was found in the river
on your farm.
The property
somehow got re-deeded.
My mother was never the same.
A month later,
she died of grief.
Leaving me and my brothers
and sisters orphaned.
And at the time, the IRA
had a heavy disciplinary hand,
so no one would take us in.
In the end,
they put us all up for adoption.
Separately.
I was sent to Belfast.
All my siblings went to England.
I've been trying
to trace them ever since.
But the documentation
was all lost,
or obscured during The Troubles.
I lost my whole family.
Not surprisingly,
I sat out
the rest of The Troubles.
I wanted an Ireland
free for all men.
Neither of yous wanted that.
So I'm gonna give you a chance
to defend yourself
with your favorite weapon.
Of course,
they won't hold me down
the way they did my father.
And I'll have one as well.
He's dead. Enough.
You could still tell who he is.
No one knew my father.
Mm-hm, okay.
James.
So sorry
not to have caught you earlier
and saved you a trip.
Wonderful news.
I managed to fast track
your retirement payment.
You'll be clear of all this rot.
- Sir, about the case...
- Don't worry about that at all.
I've had Damien here
pick up all your files.
You won't have to think about
any of these dreadful things
anymore.
You'll... You'll be at peace.
But, sir, I found the killers.
I know who they are.
Leave it, James.
You can do no more good here.
Take care now, sir.
You can keep the rest.
Lucky aim, man.
Aggravating, isn't it?
Running from one
fret into another.
Reminds me of the night you
and our heroic first minister
dropped car bombs
all over the city.
Don't worry,
I'll get him myself.
Clean sweep.
Who the hell are you?
The question is,
who I should have been.
I should have been free
to raise my wee boy
without your legacy of violence
and lies.
I want him to grow up
and not know your version
of right and wrong.
Someone always has
to buy the last round.
Ahead of this
evening's Saor Ãire Nordash.
Rioting has broken out
in several areas
where loyalist communities
have bumped the police cordon.
Soon Ireland's president
and the first minister
of Northern Ireland,
who will be delivering
the main speech tonight
has called for...
Let him through.
He's harmless.
Not so long ago,
I believed...
Owen, they're going to kill you.
Don't go out there.
For once, listen.
Owen?
Owen.
This is my city.
A world of my own making.
Owen?
We interrupt
the scheduled broadcast
to bring you
very important breaking news.
We can now confirm
that while addressing tonight's
Saor Ãire Nordash in Belfast,
the first minister
of Northern Ireland,
Owen McKenna, has been shot.
Don't you want
to hear what happened, love?
I already know.
- Hi, inspector.
- Hi.
How's the retirement going?
It's been two months already,
isn't it?
Yes, seems to have flown by.
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks.
All right. Take care.
Is violence ever justified?
You seen enough
to know that it's not.
You've heard my story.
And I'm grateful
for your silence,
which I'll take as sympathy.
But maybe
there's a better explanation
of why we did what we did.
My friend once
explained to me
that he'd had a wee boy
and it changed his life.
All he wanted was
a peaceful world for his son.
He will pay any price for that.
One day, a politician was being
driven through their street.
His wee son asked:
Who's that, Dad?
Somebody who used
to kill people.
But he doesn't anymore.
- Did he go to jail?
- No.
We wanted it all to end,
so wee ones like you
could grow up safe.
Eh?
And his reply shocked himself.
He told me afterwards,
that at that moment,
he realized he would rather live
in a world
where every misfiring car
would send him diving
to cover his son
from a bomb blast,
than in a world of peace
where his son
couldn't distinguish
between right and wrong.
I happen to agree with him
from more bitter
personal experience.
So with an eye on the future,
we decided to bury the past.
Not in silence,
but in justice.
To let it sleep.
So won't you?
I'm going for a walk, dear.
See a new day born.
And on this historic day,
as Ulster take their seats,
we can all welcome
in a new world,
a united Ireland.
Whole and at peace.
A dream that..."
20,A Belle for Christmas (2014) - full transcript,"When a sweet young boy and his precocious sister discover their newly adopted puppy Belle has been nabbed by the beautiful gold digger dating their widowed dad on Christmas Eve, the kids recruit their neighborhood friends and set out on an adventurous rescue mission to save her.","This big one.
No, no, she can't have that.
What is it, Pheebs?
What is it?
A microscope!
Excellent.
Did you want that?
- Yes?
- Yes.
How does he know
what you want?
You must have been
such a good girl.
Did Santa get it right?
Yes.
Right, Elliot,
anything for you, buddy?
Well, I think we might
have one more.
Maybe.
It might be this one.
This is what Santa gives you.
I love you.
Thank you.
It's not me, it's Santa.
No.
Yes.
Is that the one we saw?
Come on, Dad, you promised
we'd go to the festival.
Yeah, you promised.
Okay, okay.
We'll go to the festival.
- Yay!
- Yay!
Which one can I get
for three bucks?
Well, how about, if you
can convince your parents
to take one home today,
I'll give you three bucks
to buy its first bag
of puppy food?
Phoebe, no, forget it,
Dad will never go for it.
Don't listen to him.
We'll take one puppy
in a to-go box, please.
My dad won't mind.
It's a surprise.
Phoebe, no, we're about to
order.
And Dad's already mad you came
out here without permission.
Come on,
not even for the crazy-eyed spaz
in the back corner?
Oh.
Looks like I'd be
doing you the favor.
That would--
oh, there they are.
What would my two most favorite
customers like today?
How about a break
from the baloney?
Fruit tarts
for both of us, please.
Okay.
Phoebe?
Now what did we all
talk about last night?
How we should respect Daniela
'cause she's
your new girlfriend.
Yes.
No, no,
she's not my girlfriend.
Yet.
We've only gone out
a couple of times.
Now look, she's trying
really hard with you guys,
so I would appreciate it
if you would be nice--
both of you.
Okay?
All righty,
here we have two tarts for the two of you
and one yummy chocolate croissant for the handsome man.
Ooh.
I baked these fresh
just for you and you.
Well, thank you,
we appreciate it.
One piping hot
pumpkin spiced latte to go.
Thank you.
Kids, what do we say?
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
Oh, no problem.
So are we still on
for tomorrow night?
Oh, I don't know.
I forgot to ask their grandmother if she could stay.
Oh, why don't I just come over
and cook dinner for everybody?
How about that?
Yeah, that sounds--
that's wonderful.
Okay, I'll see you
at 7:00.
- Okay.
- All right.
Bye.
You lucky-lou.
What a hunky slab
of pumpkin bread that is.
I know.
Oh, and you should see
the house they live in.
It's beautiful.
It sounds almost perfect.
Too bad his kids
are such snarky little tarts.
That doesn't faze me.
Nothing a little discipline
can't fix.
Oh, it's you again.
Did your parents
change their mind?
Did your parents change
their mind about what?
Elliot, you did not tell
this nice lady
that we were looking
to adopt a dog, did you?
No, Dad, I didn't.
I just-- earlier, Phoebe
was over here and I--
Oh, I don't know
what's gotten into her.
Oh.
It looks like she likes you.
Okay, she is very, very,
very cute, okay?
But the Barrows family
household
has a very strict
no-puppy policy.
Oh, are you allergic,
Mr. Barrows?
No, no.
So may I ask why the policy?
Okay, fine, here's how
this scenario unfolds.
Adopt lovely canine for the kids
and after a couple of weeks,
kids lose interest
and Pops ends up
taking care of said canine
for the next 10 to 12.
Is that how you guys see
this scenario playing out?
No, ma'am.
'Cause it sounds like you've been skipping out on your chores
and leaving them
for good old Pops, huh?
Well, no--
well, sometimes when I say
I dusted the mantel,
when I really
just blew the surface.
But typically, no.
Because, you know,
this is a shepherd mix.
She's gonna eat a lot
and poop a lot
and shed a lot.
Basically drive you crazy
for the first year or two
that you have her.
But she's also gonna
crack you up every day.
Oh, oops.
And she's gonna
cuddle you like crazy
and basically
love you unconditionally
till her last day on Earth.
I promise you won't regret it.
That's a very, very good pitch,
I will give you that.
I'm sorry, we just can't do it.
Not this year.
But I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Come on, kids, let's go.
- Daddy, please?
- Honey, come on.
Hey, guys, will one of you
get the door, please?
Ah, my merry little
mischief makers.
It's good to see you.
Grandma.
What's wrong, Elliot?
Are you not happy to see
your wrinkly old granny?
He's crying because
you called him ""mischief maker.""
Mom called us that
sometimes, too.
Nuh-uh. I wasn't crying, Phoebe.
Grandma's perfume
burned my eyes.
Well, did your mama never tell you where that nickname came from?
She got it from herself.
Every Christmas Eve when she
and Uncle Ted were your age,
they would sneak down
the stairs
and try to unwrap
every present under the tree
without tearing
any of the wrapping paper.
One year, your mama even
got a roll of Scotch tape
and she tried
to re-tape the things
that they'd accidentally torn
and I'll tell you what,
sly old Granny
was waiting and watching.
I caught her red-handed!
Gee, Mom sure was naughty.
- Must be where I get it from.
- Maybe so.
But why call us that?
We never did anything
to earn Mom's nickname.
Well, honey, never say never.
You don't know what mischief
the holidays can bring.
I don't want Mom's nickname.
Oh, hey, Marnie,
thank you so much for coming.
I really appreciate it.
I didn't even think about
needing a sitter,
this being
the first time since--
Don't mention it.
You know I love being here.
Should I feed them
dinner, too?
No, no, I should be done
and back by 6:00, so...
Well, I'm already here.
I might as well fix them
a proper meal.
I bet the kids are getting tired
of rotisserie chicken
from the grocery store.
All right, you know me
too well, Marnie.
Thanks. Uh...
Actually, that lady friend
that I told you about,
she was actually planning on
coming by and cooking, so--
That's nice.
Maybe you can stay
and you could meet her,
unless that would be weird.
Glenn, you know,
I've told you a thousand times,
my Janey loved you.
She would want you
to find somebody
to make you
and the kids happy.
And, of course, you know
I would want to meet her.
I love you like a son.
Now you get on out of here
before it's too late.
Thank you.
See you, honey, okay?
So that's what you think of the lady your daddy's seeing?
If I said out loud
what I thought of her, Grandma,
Santa would surely skip
bringing me presents this year.
Oh, that's really bad.
Hey, buddy.
Did you ask Malcolm if he wanted to ride bikes with you?
Elliot, I don't want
to do anything
that makes you
or your sister uncomfortable.
Okay, so if it's too early
for all this stuff,
- I'll just tell Dani that--
- No, Dad, it's fine.
If you like her,
I want you to be happy.
I'm sure deep down
Phoebe does, too.
I want us all
to be happy, buddy.
Be careful out here,
will you?
- All right. Love you.
- You, too.
Boom.
Blindsided by the blonde.
What?
When my dad left, my mom said
it was because he was
blindsided by a big booty,
but your dad, same thing,
only a big-headed blonde.
Thought you were going
to a Christmas play
with your mom
at your church today.
Got out of it.
Said I had kidney beans
for a late-night snack.
And that if she took me,
I'd be pooting on the pews.
Have you ever heard
of a poot on a wooden pew?
It sounds like a choir of one
praising hallelujah.
So why didn't you want to go?
Well, it's not like
I could ever leave you alone.
You've been such a sad Santa sack ever since school let out.
How many times
do I have to I tell you?
I'm fine.
So what are you doing out here
all alone anyway?
I was trying to be alone.
Or maybe you were trying
to drive back and forth
past the Kane residence,
wait and see if a certain
third-grader was selling
hot chocolate like last year.
I already told you, Malcolm,
I don't like Riley Kane, okay?
Not even when
she's looking all fine
like that in her winter's best?
I don't know about you,
but I'm thirsty.
You're not getting free cocoa
again this year, Malcolm.
If you really have
low blood sugar,
go and see your pediatrician.
I wasn't asking for a handout.
A man with a job
gladly pays for his cocoa.
Now with extra
marshmallows, please.
And what's this alleged job
of yours anyways, Malcolm?
I scoop doggie doo
for the greater citizens
on the west block.
So what's the cause?
All proceeds go to Hands on Paws,
our local dog rescue.
Hey, they were set up
in front of the bakery.
Had a really cute pup I loved.
- You like dogs too, Elliot?
- Sure, I do.
My dad won't let us get one,
but I really wish we could.
My parents won't
let me get one either.
It's nice you're trying to help all the dogs with the fundraiser, though.
The things a boy will say
to get a girl to believe him.
What are you
talking about?
I bet he never even heard
of Hands on Paws
before you mentioned it.
Besides, you're hardly
mature enough
to handle a dog
responsibly, Elliot.
And you're hardly mature enough
to handle a gentleman
like my fine friend here.
Now quit gawking at him
like you're not mad
he didn't talk to you first,
Penny ""Whiner.""
You had your cocoa,
so leave already.
No loitering.
Goodness, I'm so sorry.
If I had known there
was gonna be a guest,
I would have brought another
cranberry Cornish hen.
But you are the guest,
so how did you not
know you'd be here, silly?
It's fine.
Phoebe and I will share.
Oh, good.
So, Daniela, what kind
of work do you do?
Oh, well, I work at the bakery
down on Main Street.
Which explains why she's such
a good cook, doesn't it, guys?
Well, now,
that's a nice little place.
So have you always lived
in Tennessee?
Oh, well, I actually lived
in L.A. for a little bit.
You know, I did some modeling
and some acting
and that just didn't pan out.
So I'm back here
starting fresh and anew.
I'm sorry.
What did you say
your last name was again?
Oh, it's Downy.
Uh, Dani actually said
she knew of Janey in school.
Yes, Daniela, I do believe
I remember you.
You were in a bunch of local pageants growing up,
as I recall.
Yes.
Yes, I was.
Fancy that, someone
who went to my pageants.
Oh, I didn't.
I just...
I read about them
in the paper, that's all.
Oh.
That's a pretty sharp memory
there, Marn.
Wait. So you knew my mom and you
think it's okay to like my dad?
Elliot, I barely knew
your mom,
you know, and I've been
getting your daddy's coffee
for over a year now
and never knew that Janey--
well, you know, I just wanted
to make you all a nice dinner.
It's just really weird.
No wonder she did bad in L.A.
That was a terrible performance.
I think you guys
owe Dani an apology.
Oh.
Ah.
Mm...
Oh, my.
You know, those ungrateful
little heathens.
I mean, those Cornish hens,
those are a real pain in my--
Oh. Just a minute.
Okay.
You all right?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
I'm really sorry.
I mean, this whole situation's
just so new for everybody,
and they're just--
Right.
I completely understand.
I mean, I know
because I lost my mother
over the holidays
and I know exactly
what they're
going through, so...
- I'm sorry. I had no idea.
- I do, I do.
Uh...
Sorry.
Elliot, are you okay, honey?
Well, if it's any consolation,
your mother didn't care
for Dani either.
But that information is strictly
between us big kids.
Pinky swear?
And I only say that
because your daddy needs
to find out for himself.
He probably thinks
he's doing what's right
for you kids right now,
but he's a smart man.
Just give him
a little time, okay?
But I thought she said
she didn't know Mom that well.
Mom didn't like her?
Honey, your mama
liked everyone.
It was Dani who was jealous
of your mom.
Why?
Well, back
when they were seniors,
your mom was voted
the most popular in school
and somehow Dani claimed that the ballots had been rigged,
but when they did a recount,
Janey won by a landslide.
Can you imagine?
Daniela Downy must have
fake cried the whole way home.
""Oh-hh!""
Ahem.
Guys, is there something
you'd like to say to Dani?
Sorry.
Is there anything else
you want to say to Dani?
Food?
Thanks for the food.
Yes, thank you, Dani.
Oh, you are so welcome.
I actually made the same meal
for the homeless
down at the shelters.
Quite a treat.
Well, that's very nice of you.
And, guys, since Dani doesn't
have any family to go home to
for the holidays, I told her
that she could spend
the holidays with us,
okay?
And thank you so much.
I mean, you don't know
how much this means to me.
I thought I was gonna
have to spend the holidays
all by myself in my dreary
little house
but, oh, we get to make pies
and play games
and, oh, it's just gonna be
the best holiday ever together!
Oh, I got lots to do.
Oh, no. Oh.
How do I--? Oh-hh.
Oh, good morning.
Hey, good morning.
How did you sleep?
Oh, that bed is more comfortable
than the one I sleep on
at home every night.
So what are you guys
up to here?
We are making French toast.
French toast!
Oh, I make
the best French toast.
Here, let me handle this.
Oh.
I've got bread, got our eggs.
Oh, milk,
I got to get some milk.
Hey, you brought the puppy!
Hi.
I didn't get your name
the other day.
- It's Elliot.
- Well, is your dad home, Elliot?
Puppy!
- Can you hold her?
- Yeah.
Elliot, did you--
No, no, it wasn't him.
It was me.
Look, I can't really explain it
but what happened with this dog
and Elliot yesterday, it's--
connections like that
aren't made every day.
This dog loves your son.
She's been crying
ever since he left.
And look, I don't want
to tell you how to parent
because I have
no experience with it.
I've never parented anything
other than the dogs
that I foster every year.
But I think in order
to learn responsibility,
you have to be given
responsibility.
And that applies
to the kids here, right?
Please, Dad? I promise
I'll take good care of her.
Pretty, pretty, pretty please?
You can even take back our--
oh, sorry.
I mean, Elliot's shares
of the presents back
if we can just have
this one puppy.
Please, Daddy, please?
I mean, you show up
on my doorstep here
with this fuzzy little bit
of cuteness
with a bow on and everything.
It's not like I ever really
had a choice, huh?
Okay.
Yay! Thank you, Daddy!
Give me the papers
and let me sign
on the dotted line
before I change my mind.
Ready for you right there.
Yes, you are.
Well, last step is you guys
have to name her.
Yeah, Elliot.
What you gonna name her?
Belle.
Her name is Belle.
Oh, what do we have
going on here?
- Hi.
- Oh--!
Bless you.
Oh, you must be the neighbor
and you adopted a dog,
isn't that nice?
Nope, she's ours
for the keeping.
And you're allergic, ain't you?
Glenn, please tell me
that you did not adopt a dog
from a complete stranger.
I mean, no offense,
you seem lovely.
She's not a stranger.
And Belle isn't a random dog.
Are you, Belle?
She's part of our family now.
Dani, this is the director
of the local dog rescue
here in town.
We actually met yesterday,
actually right outside
your bakery.
I'm Kate.
- Nice to meet you.
- Bless you.
This is Dani and Dani is--
Our homeless holiday guest.
Thanks.
You are allergic to dogs,
aren't you?
Mm-hmm, yes.
Oh, to the fur, to their drool,
to the feces-- all of it.
I had no idea.
But, you know, actually
they have shots now for that
- and they're pretty simple, so--
- Oh, really?
I'm gonna get going but
I'm gonna give you my card.
It has my cell number on it.
Call me anytime
if you need anything.
All of her papers
and she's got all of her shots.
The number
for the vet is on there
and there's
an after-hours emergency,
just in case something
goes wrong.
Perfect. That's great,
thank you so very much.
Yes, thank you,
thank you, Kate.
You are so welcome.
Merry Christmas, Kate.
- Enjoy Belle.
- We will.
- Take good care of her.
- Okay.
I appreciate it, Kate.
Thank you, very, very much.
Thank you.
Bye, guys, nice meeting you.
Yeah.
Okay, girl, let's get you
something to eat.
I bet you're starving.
Elliot, you can't just
feed her anything, okay?
She can't have chocolate.
She can't have onions...
Hey, bud.
Everything okay with Dani?
Well, at least
she stopped crying.
Belle makes you
pretty happy, doesn't she?
Yeah, I don't think
I've seen you this
consistently happy
in a long time.
Belle is so happy
all the time.
I've got to work hard
to keep up, you know.
And I've been telling Belle
all about Mom.
How she was the most amazing
architect ever
and how we used to lay
on the floor of her study
and draw pictures
while she would work
on blueprints at her desk.
You don't think Mom's starting to think that I forgot about her
because Belle
makes me so happy?
No, no, no way, buddy,
no way.
Your mom,
she is watching down on you.
And every single time
that you or your sister smile,
I promise you,
she smiles, too.
And speaking of drawing,
you know, I haven't
seen you draw in a long time.
You used to draw everywhere.
You ever think about
taking it back up?
I'm just saying there's
this pretty girl up the street
who could probably use
a sketch of Belle for Christmas,
seeing as how she doesn't
have a dog of her own.
- I don't know.
- No? Hey, no pressure.
Just a creative mind
can get you pretty far, buddy.
I mean, your mom's
ability to design,
that was just one of the--
one of the many reasons
that I fell in love with her.
Just think about it.
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night, Dad.
""Dear Janey, Merry Christmas
to you and yours.
I know we haven't spoken
for some time now,
but I just wanted you know
that your presence--""
Hey, Marnie, good morning.
I have a quick
question for you.
Do you know if Janey
ever designed
some home plans
down in Wimberley?
Yeah, I don't remember
that either.
I was just curious.
Okay, we're gonna
see you later today?
Okie-dokie, bye-bye.
- Good morning.
- Oh, hey.
Oh, you have to work
on Christmas Eve?
Yeah, it's Honey Brook
Annual Baking Contest
and I have to get a four-tiered
red velvet Christmas cake ready
before 5:00
for the attendees.
Would you--
would you like to come?
Oh!
Yeah, that sounds
like it'd be fun.
I think the kids
would enjoy that.
And you could probably use a little break from your allergies, too.
Yeah. Well, why don't I
just come back around 6:00
and you and me and the kids,
we can all ride together?
- That sounds great.
- All right.
You have a really
good day, dear.
Thank you.
Ooh. Sorry.
You have a good day.
Hey, kids, why don't you guys
get dressed in something decent
and come on down here.
We're gonna take a little road trip.
I still don't see
why we couldn't bring Belle.
Well, because, Elliot,
what happens in the New Year
when you start school again?
She has to learn to stay home by herself a little bit each day.
Ooh, looks delish.
What's wrong?
I thought you were ecstatic
to be spending the holidays
with the big-shot boyfriend,
the lawyer and his rugrats.
You said it was your
""champagne dream come true.""
It was, until that Belle
came along.
Bell?
Like a sleigh bell?
No, more like a mangy
eight-pound ball of fur
who cries constantly
and drools incessantly
and whose breath smells
like a cheesy bacon fart.
Oh, they got a puppy!
How cute.
I mean, ooh, how gross.
I mean, I hope you put out
rat traps for the little vermin.
Hmm...
So what are you
gonna do now?
Huh?
What can I do?
I mean, this dog
has won the affections
of this entire household
before I could even
get my favorite
crocodile boots
through the door.
Glenn included.
These kids,
they can't stand me.
Oh, but ever since that dog--
oh, my gosh, I can't even
be in the house
without sneezing my head off.
I guess it's back
to the old drawing board
for my future.
What am I supposed to do?
Maybe, maybe you could date
that Skip Jeffries
that comes in here all the time.
He's really pretty cute.
Uh, Kimmy, he's a plumber.
Yeah.
Yeah, he comes in here
and he unclogs toilets.
- Oh.
- And every time he bends over,
I feel like I'm visiting
the Grand Canyon.
You know, I don't think so.
Oh! Oh!
Look at what you
made me do!
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, God, you got me so upset.
You still look really pretty
even covered in batter.
I cannot go to the contest
looking like this.
I got to get home and change.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, okay. You finish the cakes,
I will be back in 30 minutes.
Okay.
We're here, guys.
Elliot, ring
the doorbell, please.
Yes, Dad.
Yes, may I help you?
Hi, yeah, I'm Glenn Barrows.
I'm Janey Barrows' husband.
Oh, my,
what a wonderful surprise.
And this must be
Elliot and Phoebe.
Yes, ma'am.
I've heard Janey speak
many times of them.
Where is Janey?
Actually, that's what I came here to talk to you about.
Oh, okay.
Well, please do come in.
Thank you.
Well, let's just see
if there is anything left
on Mr. Barrows'
Christmas wish list
after he's had a slice
of this red velvet cake.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Ah.
Oh, you have been waiting
under the wrong Christmas tree.
Malcolm, are you trying
to give me a heart attack?
What did I tell you about
firecrackers in the front yard
before New Year?
Get your butt over here, boy.
Kimmy, Kimmy,
phone call for you.
Will you please take it
on the kitchen line?
Yes, ma'am.
- Hello?
- Oh, Kimmy, it's me.
I was wondering
if you could whip up
some of that
cream cheese frosting.
I'm gonna be a little later
than I thought.
Copy that.
I'll be licking the beaters
till you get back.
Um, is everything okay?
Oh, everything is just
powdered sugar now.
I'm actually on my way
to displace
this little fleabag
in her new home right now.
Okay.
See you when you get back.
Y'all come on now, have a seat.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
This is beautiful.
Oh, well, thank you.
- Grandma?
- Yes, come on, baby.
- Come on.
- Thank you.
Now this here is my grandbaby,
Miss Adelaide.
Her mom and daddy
went out to get us
a nice smoked ham
for dinner, didn't they?
Hi.
You can call me Addie.
Hi, Addie,
I'm Phoebe and this is my little brother Elliot.
He's shy.
My daddy made me
a Santa sleigh.
- You want to see?
- Sure.
Wait, wait,
now y'all get your cookies.
Oh.
Just one each, just one.
Okay.
Well, you're lucky.
I was just making
my afternoon tea.
Perfect, that's gonna
hit the spot, thank you.
Oh, you're welcome.
You know,
when that flood came through,
this tea set was one of the few things I was able to salvage.
I remember that.
That was terrible.
I bet you do.
Lord, they sure look an awful lot like her,
don't they?
You know,
it's a shame that Janey
couldn't come
with you all today.
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.
Um...
see, we lost Janey
earlier this year...
in a car accident.
I am so sorry
for your loss, Glenn.
I can't tell you how much
this breaks my heart.
She was a good peach,
that girl.
She was one of the best
of the bundle.
Yes, she really was.
And that's the thing is--
See, I got your Christmas card
this morning,
but how did you know Janey?
Because I don't remember
her doing any work--
Oh, my heavens.
She never told you.
Thank you.
Seriously?
Serious as Santa
in a snowstorm.
My Janey blueprinted
the remodeling
of every single home
in this entire neighborhood?
It was over the year
after the flood came through.
You know, most of us
didn't have insurance.
Since we weren't
in a floodplain,
we didn't think
it could happen to us.
And Janey didn't charge
a one of us a dime,
even helped us
find cheap contractors
to do the labor, too.
I mean, come on, how did you
not notice how busy she was?
Then again, I thought she said
she had another job, too.
No, she was always
very, very busy
but she always made time
for me and the kids.
She seemed like the kind of girl
who always somehow
found enough hours
in a day.
I just don't understand,
I don't know why
she never said
anything to us about this.
I can't say for sure,
but I will tell you this.
I've seen people
who are always preaching
about the things that others
should be doing
and keeping a spreadsheet
of every nice thing
they ever did for you
and always expecting
every good deed to come
with some big reward.
I mean, heck,
most kind gestures,
well, they come with a price.
Now, while there are still
others I've known
to do things--
good, kind, loving things,
who do them quietly
in the privacy of their own
hearts and minds--
simply because they believe
it's the right thing to do.
Elliot, Pheebs,
come here, guys.
Adelaide, come here, baby.
Come here, guys.
You take a look at every single
one of these houses, okay?
See them?
Your mother is responsible
for every one of these.
- Wow.
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Our mom was the coolest.
Yeah, she was.
- You guys are pretty cool, too.
- Thanks, Dad.
Get back.
Now get back.
Hello, bird.
Hello, there.
For heaven's sakes, Alberta.
Sorry about that.
We just weren't expecting anybody,
being Christmas Eve and all.
Oh, that's okay.
Special occasions
call for special deliveries.
And what kind of special
deliveries do we have here?
Well, this little beast
needs to be put down.
Now why would you
want to have
a little looker like this
put down for?
She'd probably have no problem
finding a great home.
Oh, well, I was supposed to be
her forever home,
that's why I adopted her.
But then,
once I got her home,
I shortly realized that
she's a complete lost cause.
- A lost cause?
- Mm-hmm.
How so?
Hmm? Well, um,
she killed my cat.
She killed your cat?
She's barely the size of a cat.
It was a very small cat.
A kitten.
Now are you sure we're
talking about the same dog?
This dog right here?
Oh, yeah, don't be deceived
by her charms, mister.
I am telling you,
this dog is a killer.
She even killed some birds.
Yep, in my back yard,
she killed these, like, parrots,
sparrow-looking things.
A bird killer, huh?
Well, I might just have to move
this one to the top of my list.
Wonderful.
How soon can it be done?
Sunday morning, on account of
we're closed for Christmas.
Well, but you said
humanely, right?
I mean, I don't want her
to suffer or anything.
Mm-hmm.
Belle?
Belle?
Belle!
Where do you think you're going?
Shut up.
I'm not covering you for this time and you will be totally busted.
Why am I the only sane person
in my family?
Belle.
Belle?
Come here, Belle.
Come here, Belle.
- Hey, guys, no luck yet?
- No. Come on.
Let's you and I go this way
and you guys go that way.
Okay, fine,
but do not go on the road unless you see Belle, okay?
- Don't leave our subdivision.
- Yes, sir.
Belle? Belle?
Thank God you're back.
I don't know how to ice this thing.
Don't worry,
I have it all under control.
- And the little dog, too?
- I told you, everything.
So you, like, killed it?
- No, I didn't kill it.
- Oh.
What kind of a monster
do you take me for?
I took it to be euthanized.
Oh. Oh!
So I've exactly one hour
to get this cake tiered
into confection perfection
and then I got to pick up
the kids and Glenn,
hold them for about five minutes
while they cry
over the untimely disappearance
of their little mutt
and then bring them back here
in time for the contest,
where they can have a nice big piece of my red velvet cake.
Hmm?
Thank you.
Elliot, we should turn back.
Maybe we passed her,
or maybe your dad
and Phoebe found her by now.
Hey, look, we're
gonna find her, okay?
I will help you look for her
every day until we do.
I pinky promise.
Okay, come on.
Let's get back to the house.
Belle, Belle?
Hi, Kate, this is Glenn Barrows.
I'm calling about Belle.
It seems that she's gone missing
and we can't find her anywhere.
Could you please give me a call
as soon as you get this message?
Thank you.
Elliot, did you ask Malcolm
if he saw any sign
of Belle this afternoon?
His mom said he had to call back
after they finished
Christmas dinner.
- Dad, we have to find her.
- I know, honey.
But there's nothing more
that we can do right now.
I still can't figure out
how she got out the front door.
I was sure we closed it.
Hey!
How's it going?
Are we all ready to go have
some delicious Christmas treats?
Oh, why the long faces?
It's Belle, she went missing
this afternoon.
We can't find her anywhere.
Oh.
Oh, that's just terrible.
Oh, well-- do you have any idea
where she could be?
No, we've been up
and down the block twice.
We've asked everybody,
nobody has seen any sign of her.
Oh.
Maybe if you guys go to the square,
you could ask around.
Maybe somebody has
seen her running around.
That's not a bad idea.
But, Dad, I don't want
to go to the square.
If Belle comes back,
I have to be here.
Listen, I'm sure she's fine.
I'm sure we'll find her.
Let's just go up
to the square and see.
Maybe she's been
running around up there.
You're wasting
your breath, lady.
We ain't moving
till Belle's back.
Glenn, here.
Listen, why don't we
just leave the kids here?
You could call Marnie
and she could watch them.
You know, 'cause this is my thing.
I got to be there tonight.
I know that, but Marnie,
that's not gonna happen.
She has this midnight mass
with a lady she does every year.
I'm sorry.
Guys, see what she's wearing?
She wasn't wearing that
this morning.
She's obviously been back
to change since we left.
Bet she's the one who left
the door open-- on purpose.
Ahem.
Guys, listen.
Why don't we go to the square
and we can put up
some missing puppy flyers?
Okay, and then
in the morning I promise you,
we will go out and we will look
for Belle again.
But, Dad, if Belle comes back,
I have to be here.
Oh, Elliot, that's just
not gonna happen.
I mean, she's a puppy,
they're not that smart.
Who knows
where she could be?
I bet you know
exactly where she is.
I'm sorry?
You took Belle.
We know it was you.
Pheeb, honey,
it's pretty obvious
that Belle went out
the open front door.
Probably because
she left it open.
I mean, you got to admit,
it would be a lot easier for her
to reach the front door handle
than it would be for Belle to,
that's for darn sure.
Phoebe, I haven't
been here today. Okay?
I mean, I left the house
before you did this morning.
Yeah? Well, you weren't
wearing that tacky dress
the first time you left.
Listen, I went to my house
and I changed my clothes
this afternoon, okay?
That's a lie.
I saw that ugly thing the first night
when I was checking your bags
for narcotics and firearms.
You went through
my suitcase?
Phoebe, we do not
go through
other people's
private belongings.
You know better than that,
young lady.
Dad, she doesn't even care
about us.
She just wants you
because you're a hot catch
and you have lots of money.
That's it. Phoebe,
apologize to Dani right now.
No, Dad.
Phoebe's right.
Dani did something to Belle.
Just look at her,
it's written all over her face.
- Elliot, you are not helping.
- And neither are you.
You're being blindsided
by that big-headed blonde.
Oh!
Guys, what is wrong with you?
Knock it off.
Do you know that Dani lost
her mother at Christmas, too?
You need to think about
other people's feelings, too.
Maybe the holidays are tough
for other people as well.
- But, Dad, she--
- No, but nothing, Elliot.
Okay, Belle
is gone right now,
there's nothing
we can do about it.
But if we're gonna accuse
somebody of doing something,
you need to have evidence.
All right?
Then tomorrow, like I said,
we will go
and we will look for Belle.
In the meantime, you guys
are making me wonder
whether you were ever
responsible enough
to have adopted this dog
in the first place.
Dani, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, Dani.
No.
Hey, hey, I am so sorry.
The kids, they didn't mean
the stuff that they were saying.
They didn't. They just--
I think they're just taking
this whole dog thing so hard
because they really
just miss their mom.
They do.
And your bakery contest thing,
it sounds like a lot of fun.
I get it. It's just--
it's that I told all my
co-workers
that they were gonna meet
this really great guy, you know?
And it's all right,
I'll just be by myself.
Okay?
I'll just be all alone,
by myself like I always am.
I'm very used to it, it's okay.
- All right?
- Dani.
Come on.
I feel terrible,
but what else can I do?
The kids won't go
anywhere without Belle
and I can't leave them
here alone.
Well, I mean, if you came
with me for just a little bit,
then you could
put up those signs.
I know somebody
who could look after them.
All right. Listen up.
You will do exactly as I say
or I will call the evil little elves to come and get you
and take you away
where you will be fed nothing
but clear-colored snow cones
without sugar
and placed on an assembly line
making fun toys
for everyone but yourselves
year round. Got it?
Good.
Now do you have any
caramel glaze in the kitchen?
Guys, we can't just sit here.
Belle has to be out there
somewhere right now
and might really need our help.
Well, what do you
expect us to do?
""Cheesecake Monster""
over there
sure isn't gonna let us
out of her sights anytime soon.
I know.
We just have to figure out a way to get out of here.
Hello?
It's for you.
But make it quick.
Is it Dad?
Did they find Belle?
Not now.
Sorry, Hambone.
I was eating turkey.
My mom says you called earlier.
It's Belle, we can't find her.
What do you mean
you can't find her?
She was gone tonight
when we got home.
And the front door was open.
You didn't see her
outside, did you?
Nope, but I did see that
big-headed blonde over there
earlier this afternoon
when I was giving Penny Reiner
a Christmas Eve scare
with my stampede string
of Black Cats.
She was here this afternoon?
Um, I mean,
you saw Belle where?
I said I saw
the big-headed blonde.
Yeah, I heard what you said,
but we actually
can't go looking
for Belle right now
unfortunately,
because my dad is not here
and we've a sitter.
You have a sitter?
Yeah, a friend of my dad's
new girlfriend.
She's really nice, too.
Dude, you're freaking me out.
Are you in trouble
or something?
Yeah, we're pretty bummed
about Belle, too,
but sure,
an early Christmas gift from you
actually would lift my spirits,
I think.
Name the gift
and Santa will deliver.
Hey, no visitors tonight, okay?
Wait.
The babysitter says you can't
bring it tonight, though.
Santa don't wait for no sitter.
Wait, what's that?
You got me the same thing
you got Penny Reiner?
Wow, thanks, Malcolm.
I love that awesome collection
of, um... cat stamps.
""Operation Jingle Belle
Jailbreak""
is in T-minus 10 minutes
and counting.
So Malcolm said he thought
he saw Belle
in Mr. Polinsky's back yard.
Really?
You can see their back yard
from your room upstairs.
I know, let's go.
Belle!
Belle, if you can hear me,
wave one paw in the light.
Sorry, kids, but your dog
is not down in that yard.
Well, guess it's a good thing.
I was just worried about what
Mr. Polinsky swore he would do
if he ever caught our dog
in his back yard.
What did he swear
he would do?
Well, he said he would
take his .22 rifle
and open fire
on our front lawn.
But, Elliot, I always thought
Mr. Polinsky was so nice.
Huh, the craziest ones
usually are.
Mal--
Your neighbor,
he sounds like a real loony.
If I were you, I'd move away
before he decides to blow
this whole neighborhood.
Kids, get down! It's not Santa!
Has Mr. Polinsky gone postal?
Elliot, I'll meet you outside.
Hurry, hurry.
Rugrats?
Any of you still alive?
Wow. Good job, Elliot.
What?
You guys tricked me!
Yeah, and if you make
even so much
as one peep while we're gone,
I'll call Santa
and you'll be forced to shovel
reindeer poop for an eternity.
So what's next?
Elliot's calling us a ride.
But where are we going?
We're going to save Belle.
Come on.
Ugh. What's taking
Grandma so long?
So I hear my merry
mischief makers
need a little lift into town.
It's like a fallen ice skater's
frostbit bottom out there.
Are you kids
getting in or what?
Okay, so now what?
We need to get inside the bakery
and find Dani's purse.
What do we need
from her purse?
Her address and her keys.
If she took Belle,
that's where she will be.
Wait. What if we
run into Dani or your dad
moving through all these people?
We'll be totally busted.
Good point.
Phoebe, let's get eyes
on Dani and Dad, will you?
Yeah, all right.
Excuse me, mister, I'm having
a hard time locating my father.
Can I trouble you
for an elevator ride
up to your top floor?
Well, sure, kid,
and while you're up there,
why don't you see
if they've got a Danish?
I think they're gonna run out
before I can get to the table.
- Okay.
- Now, so you know, every piece...
Oh, yeah, there's
a big plate of them.
...I will make. Yay!
All right, now the line starts
right here, right by Santa.
Man down, man down!
Did she see you?
No, I don't think so.
And we're clear if we go around back.
Dad and Dani are at the front.
Phoebe, wait.
Where are you going?
Don't worry.
Just get the keys and address.
I'll meet you around back
in 10 minutes.
Okay.
Come on.
Oh, this cheesecake
is amazing.
Oh, I made the red velvet.
Oh, yeah, that's not bad either.
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.
It's so good.
Thank you.
Oh. Oh, you got a bunch
in your-- right here.
Your-- let me see. Yeah.
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.
That's all right.
Mmm.
Bingo.
Bingo.
I think I have it.
5217 Spicewood Road.
Got them.
Someone's coming.
Hide!
Ahem.
Kate, hi.
Thanks for calling me back.
Sorry, I've been so busy
with Christmas stuff.
Have you guys found Belle?
No, no, we have not yet,
unfortunately.
I'll come right over
and help you guys look.
Yeah, I'd like that.
Great.
I'll be at the house in 15.
We can drive the kids
around to find her.
Okay, great.
Wow.
Run!
You mischievous
little mongrels!
I don't know if you think
you know what you're up to,
but I can promise you,
you won't get away with it!
Ugh!
Is everything all right?
Oh, it's just all
powdered sugar.
Yeah, I can see that.
- What?
- 'Cause--
Oh, I'll be right back.
Wait, wait,
Dani, Dani, wait.
I really need to get back
for the kids
'cause they're gonna be
so worried about Belle.
Do you need to go clean up
or do you mind if I go back?
No, no, you just--
you go on home.
It's okay.
I'm sure the kids will be
waiting for you with bells on.
Well, just call me when you
want me to come pick you up.
- I'll just be a bit.
- Okay. Give me a call then.
That was a close call.
That was awesome.
Phoebe,
where have you been?
Found Dad's car
down on the street corner,
swiped his GPS.
How else were we gonna go
to Dani's house?
You're a genius.
Okay, it's only
four blocks from here.
We need to go that way.
Wait. How did you get
into a locked car?
Where there's a woman,
there's a way.
Hey, Mom.
Bet you're wondering
why I'm out here
all alone at night
without Dad, huh?
Well, don't worry too much.
I'm not in too much trouble--
well, yet anyway.
You see,
Dad let us adopt this dog
and I named her Belle,
and she's this adorable,
cream-colored shepherd
and you would just love her.
But I guess if you're
looking down on me,
you probably already
know all of this, huh?
Well, I guess I just
wanted to let you know
that no matter
where I go or what I do,
every time you see me smile,
I think of you.
Merry Christmas, Mom.
We love you.
- Kate, hi.
- Hey.
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Yeah.
- Sorry, it took me so long.
- No, it's fine.
- Did you knock on the door?
- Yeah, they didn't answer.
Really?
Phoebe?
Elliot?
Kimmy? Hello?
Oh.
Looks like someone
had a serious Christmas party.
Kids?
What the heck?
- Oh.
- Kimmy?!
- Oh, my gosh.
- Are you okay?
What happened to you?
Where are the kids?
What happened to me
are those kids!
What do you mean?
Where are the kids?
- The kids did this to me!
- Where are the kids?
I don't know.
They're probably looking for that dog
they're all worried about.
The kids think that Dani
did something to the dog.
You don't think they went
to the bakery, do you?
- I was just there.
- I don't know.
But whatever they're doing,
it's probably illegal.
Look, my kids
may be a handful
but they would never do
something illegal.
Okay, guys, let's look
for signs everywhere,
anywhere that Belle
could possibly be. All right?
- Okay.
- Okay.
I'm gonna take Mundy Lane
to Carlson Circle.
Great. Okay, I'll take
Maple Drive to City Square.
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.
You've got to be kidding me.
Jackpot.
Hello, Dani, this is Linda.
Remember me?
Your mother?
You're treating your father and me like we're dead,
but we're not.
We're in Florida
and we thought we talked about
you coming down
for the holidays.
Call me back.
Love you, dear.
Belle?
Belle?
I thought you'd be here.
Where are you, girl?
Hi, honey, we're just finishing up here,
just cleaning up.
I was wondering if you
could pick me up in 20?
Yeah, okay, but, Dani,
have you seen the kids?
- Have they been by there?
- No, I haven't seen them.
Okay, well, they left the house.
I'm out looking
for them right now.
If they come by,
will you please give me a call?
Gosh,
anything for your kids, honey, anything.
Okay, thanks.
Maybe Dad was right.
Maybe Dani didn't
really take Belle.
And maybe we did just
imagine all this in our heads
because we don't like
that Dad has a new girlfriend.
But, Elliot,
you weren't imagining that Dani is a terrible person.
And just because Belle is not
here,
doesn't mean Dani is not responsible for her disappearance.
Yeah, she could have left
the front door open
'cause she knew Belle would go
running outside looking for you.
But, guys, it doesn't matter.
Belle isn't here.
If she's not here,
then I have no idea
where she could possibly be.
And if I can't find her,
then I can't save her!
So what?
So Belle is not here.
So we go home and
start over again tomorrow.
Recruit more help
and start another search.
And we keep looking for her
until we find her.
The world doesn't
work that way, Riley.
I keep looking and waiting
for my mom all the time.
But look around,
she's still not here, is she?
And it's 'cause
she's never coming back.
And sooner or later,
we need to accept
that Belle isn't either.
Elliot, you're right. Sometimes
rotten things happen to us,
and there's nothing
we can do about it.
But that doesn't mean we should
give up on everyone else
who still loves us
and needs us.
I mean, what if Belle's
out there right now,
and she's hurt or scared
and still needs our help?
Do you really think Belle
would give up on you that easy?
Or would your mother have,
if she was still here?
You know what?
You're right, Riley.
My mom would never have given up.
So neither can we.
Christmas is still
the season of hope
and Belle has to be
out there somewhere still,
and counting on us
to find her.
Then let's go get her.
Hello, you've reached
the answering service
of Daniela Downy
and although I can't get
to the phone at the moment,
please feel free
to leave me a pleasantry
and I'll be sure to return it soon.
Dani, it's Kimmy.
You wouldn't believe what those
snarky little tarts did to me.
Anyway, I just wanted
to give you a heads-up.
Their dad's looking
for them now.
But I think they went
to find that dog.
So you better call the pound
and make sure
they remove that pup
from visibility
until someone pulls the plug on it.
We have to get to the pound
before they close.
But they're probably
already closed.
Then we break in.
We have to.
There might not be
much time.
Dani is trying
to have her put to sleep.
But we can't put
the pound into the GPS
because we don't even know
where we're going
and we don't even have
their address.
Right. We need someone
with a phone and a car.
Who do we know?
Well, if we had proof,
we could call Dad.
No, it's too late.
We can't call Dad.
He's already out
looking for us,
which means
we're in a ton of trouble.
Is there anyone else?
Wait, I know someone.
We're not going.
Christy, no, you promised
you would take us to the pound.
Yeah, well, that was
to get you in the car.
I'm now 30 minutes late
for my champagne cider party
because of you,
and Troy already went without me
because I had to pick up you and your sweaty little friends back there.
But, Christy,
Elliot's dog's life is at stake here.
If the dog is there,
Elliot's dad can take them to pick it up Sunday.
Psst. Hey, Riley.
20 bucks to prove you're right.
And I know you need it
after Dad cut off your allowance
for failing algebra.
It's locked.
Hey, mister, sorry to bother you
on Christmas Eve,
but I think you have
our dog in there.
Oh, yeah?
What makes you think that?
Well, we think the lady
dating our dad
dropped her off so you guys
could kill her.
How do you know
it's really yours?
- Is it microchipped?
- Not yet.
We've only had her
for a couple of days.
- What's it look like?
- She's a cream-colored shepherd.
Small, cute, fluffy.
""Small, cute, fluffy.""
No, I don't got
no cute dogs in here.
She would have been
dropped off today
by a big-headed blonde lady.
Oh, yeah, the bird-killer.
""Bird-killer""?
Belle never killed any bird.
How would you know?
You just said you've only
had her for a few days.
Because I think I know
my own dog pretty well, okay?
All right, fine.
That'll be 60 bucks
and you can buy
the little mutt back.
60 bucks?
We don't have 60 bucks.
Here, this is all we have left.
You don't got 40 more dollars,
I don't got no bird-killer
for you.
Ugh. Now what?
Come on, I've got an idea.
...the more
the muscle's gonna grow, okay?
Take a look
at what I've done here.
No freaking way.
Those toes just aren't
gonna pedicure themselves.
Hi.
My name is Christy Kane.
You know, like a candy cane?
- Hi.
- I'm sorry to bother you,
but I was just on my way home
from this apple cider party
and I just had
way too much cider, you see,
and I just don't think
I can wait till I get home,
so may I use
your ladies' room?
Yeah. My bird drinks
way too much apple cider, too.
Come on.
Bathroom is right
through there.
Just holler at me if you need
any toilet paper or anything.
Thanks.
""Toilet paper."" Stupid!
Belle!
So how are we gonna get her?
You guys are
just gonna stay here
and when he goes back
in that office,
we're just gonna sneak up
and spring him out really fast,
so we all can run
right out of here, okay?
But, Elliot, what about
the others?
We can't just leave
the other dogs here.
This is the pound.
They'll all be doomed
unless we save them.
I know,
but we can't fit all of them in your sister's car.
There's not enough room.
There's a bunch
of other dogs in here.
We may not be able
to fit all of them
in your fine sister's car,
but I bet we can fit
some of them
into that pound van
we saw out back.
We just need keys.
And as it just so happens,
I happen to know
a really good key thief.
- All better now?
- Yeah.
Thanks, I really appreciate you
letting me use your restroom.
Yeah.
Which translates to
I wouldn't stand on that toilet
in my cheapest pair
of shoes.
And a very
merry Christmas to you.
Merry Christmas to you, too,
Miss Kane.
Ooh.
Huh.
Malcolm, now you pull the van up
so we can load.
Riley, you and I
will need to take one side.
We'll go down one by one
till all the dogs
are out safely, all right?
Come on.
Phoebe, let's go!
What are you kids doing?
Malcolm, let's move!
I have to call the police.
Malcolm...?
You okay, girl?
I've been worried sick about you.
It's good to have you back.
You did all right tonight,
Elliot.
I didn't think
you had it in you.
I did.
But, guys, how are we gonna feed
all these dogs tomorrow?
The pet stores won't be open
on Christmas.
We can call Kate
from the rescue.
She will know
what to do with them.
Who is that following us?
I think it's that
crazy dog catcher.
Uh-oh.
Dad's on our trail now, too.
Oh, man, if I get arrested,
my mom's gonna kill me!
Pull over before
he causes a wreck.
Now that we have Belle,
my dad will get us out of trouble.
Pull over right there!
I'm trying!
Whoa!
No, not my cake!
Is everybody okay?
We're great, Dad.
Look, we even found Belle.
So how was your night?
Get out.
- You need some help up?
- Oh.
But, Dad, we had
to take the other dogs
or else
he was gonna kill them.
Elliot, that is not your place.
Okay, you should know
that stealing someone's vehicle
is a very serious offense,
especially if that vehicle
belongs to the city.
Oh. Oh, you must be
from the pound.
Yeah, look, I'm so sorry
about any trouble this might have caused you tonight,
but it's a big mix-up.
See, this dog here,
this actually is our dog.
Yeah?
Well, if you want it back,
it's gonna cost you,
Mr. Fancy Pants.
Um...
Okay. How much for the dog,
and, you know,
to keep this little Christmas incident between the two of us?
What?
For that amount--
Okay, okay.
Sure, that's just fine.
No plastic.
No.
No, of course.
All right.
Um...
Thanks.
You can just return my van
after you transport the pups.
Enjoy them.
Thanks, Dad.
You're our hero.
Yeah.
And sorry we left the house
without your permission.
Well, that's okay,
actually I'm sorry.
I apologize to you guys.
I should have never left you
on Christmas Eve.
But, we still have plenty
to talk about, okay?
And don't even think about
keeping any more of these dogs.
We are not gonna do that.
We will, however,
find homes for each
and every one of them.
And you guys
will have plenty of time to look
because you're both grounded.
Wait, where's Belle?
Oh, no.
Oh, this is all your fault,
you mangy, little
homewrecking--
Oh!
Back off,
big-headed blondie.
We know you lied
and we know you took Belle
and left her
at the pound to be killed.
Glenn, do you hear this?
Do you hear what they
are accusing me of?
Oh, come on.
What kind of proof do you have anyway?
It's all on this machine.
Including a recent message from your mom,
who must somehow
be calling from the grave...
or is it Florida?
Wait, you broke into my house
and you stole things?
It's not really breaking in
when you have the keys.
Plus, we did it for the right reason,
unlike you, who took Belle
and stole jewelry that was my mother's for your own gain, right?
Is that my wife's necklace?
Um, I--
I was just trying it on
and I was going to return it,
but I just--
I got busy with the cake
and the children's hospital
and everything.
I was just trying to--
How do you
see yourself, Dani?
Are you one of those people
who expects some kind of reward
with every single good deed
that you do?
Have you ever just one time
done something kind
and loving just because
it was the right thing to do?
I already have
my opinion on that.
May I have my wife's
necklace, please?
Let's go, kids.
Your red velvet?
It needs work, too.
She's right about
your red velvet, Dani.
Oh, and by the way,
you're fired, dear.
Well, if it looks like a duck,
quacks like a duck,
it's probably a golddigger.
Maybe you ought to go on home,
see your folks.
It is the holidays after all.
I can't stand my folks.
That's why I'm like this.
'Tis the season to forgive,
little lady.
Besides, I wouldn't
wait around for Santa.
He's not gonna bring you
any gifts this year.
ï¿½
- You all right there, Marn?
- Ooh.
Midnight mass
is still talking to me.
Ooh.
Ooh, that's probably Kate
from the shelter.
You kids sure lived up
to your merry mischief maker
nickname this year.
Elliot, it's for you.
Hi.
Hey.
Guess what?
I can keep him.
Really?
That's awesome.
Yeah, they were so terrified
that I wasn't in bed last night,
so they couldn't say no.
Thanks.
Rufus will love having this
on the days
we can't see Belle.
Which hopefully
won't be many.
Merry Christmas, Riley.
Merry Christmas to you,
Elliot.
âª Angels we have heard on high âª
âª Sweetly singing
o'er the plains âª
âª And the mountains
in reply âª
- âª Echoing their joyous strains... âª
- Hey, guys, get out here.
âª Gloria âª
âª In excelsis Deo... âª
âª Gloria âª
âª In excelsis Deo. âª
Wow.
That was amazing.
- Oh, my pleasure.
- Wow.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.
- Hi.
- Hey.
How are the dogs?
They are safe and sound.
Right. Hey, well,
come on inside, please.
Everybody, please come on inside
for some eggnog,
maybe a hot toddy,
some hot chocolate.
Come on, come on."
21,A Beloved Wife (2019) - full transcript,"A comedic portrait of an unhappy marriage between an unemployed screenwriter and his wife who's supported him for 10 years, based on the writer/director's own autobiography.","It's been about two months
since I had sex with my wife last time.
As I haven't had sex
with other women than her, either,
I haven't had sex with anybody
for the whole two months.
As I'm not asexual
like many men are these days,
I want to have sex
once or twice a month at least.
""VIOLENT HOT SPRING""
""VIOLENT HOT SPRING""
However
I'm a scenario writer having almost
no job in years past.
""Awarding Honorable Mention to
""VIOLENT HOT SPRING""""
""I wish to write scripts for a serial drama
and a popular film once a year!""
If I were a popular,
successful scenario writer,
I would want to take one or two mistresses.
But in reality, my annual income is
less than 500.000 yen.
I can't afford to take mistresses
nor to pick up a prostitute.
So, the only option I have is
to have sex with my wife.
However, it's meaninglessly hard
to accomplish it.
In order to have sex with her,
even though her body is not fresh for me,
I need to take the initiative
in doing housework and child-rearing.
In other words,
I try everything to please her.
Hey, what are you doing?
Massaging.
Stop it. Where is Aki?
Watching TV in the living room.
Go join her. I'm still sleepy
because I went to bed late last night.
Hey.
How many episodes of ""God Tongue""
have you watched?
Three.
Enough! You should really stop it now.
""Kiss Pressure Game"" is
very exciting to watch.
If you were the one to flirt them,
two seconds would be enough to beat them.
Stop whispering like that.
Besides, something is touching my butt.
What? Tell me
what was touching your butt now.
Hey. I'm not going to have sex with you.
I'm exhausted for having worked
for the whole week.
That's why I'm massaging you.
Back off now. You are poor at it anyway.
I'm getting better at it.
Since I love you,
I can't stop myself massaging you.
I know you work hard every day.
It's your fault.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll try harder.
Hey, why don't we try
playing ""Kiss Pressure Game"" together?
- I'll never do it with you.
- What? Then with whom?
Jeez, you're so annoying.
Who exactly do you want me to become?
Koichi Sato?
I don't care. Just leave me alone
and let me go back to sleep now.
You can go back to sleep
while I'm gently massaging you.
Wow, this part needs to be massaged more.
- I said back off!
- Ow!
We've been married for 10 years.
I had no idea how hard
it would become to have sex with my wife.
I didn't expect this situation at all.
Gaku Hamada
Asami Mizukawa
""A BELOVED WIFE""
Turn off the TV now.
It's time to have a breakfast.
- Let me watch it a little longer, please.
- No, you can't.
Hey, you also should stop
touching your phone and turn off the TV.
Hey, listen! The news says
Yoshiya Sakamoto is having an affair.
Seriously? With whom?
With a bikini idol.
I can't believe this. I liked him.
He is getting involved
with helping the society,
such as building schools
in developing countries.
He may be just trying to sell his name.
I heard he sticks his nose
in script and production.
What an ugly face.
You always make me feel down.
Don't you dare opening your mouth.
Go take Aki outside with you after eating
so that I can clean the house.
I would never want to work with
such an arrogant man.
There is no chance for you to do that
in the first place.
Not again! Bean sprout?
What? Not again, you said?
It's OK, but I want to have sushi
once in a while.
How could you complain to me?
Aki, start eating now.
Daddy will take you to the park later.
Really? Then, I want to go to
the Elephant Park.
How about going to the library?
I prefer the Elephant Park!
It'll be hot outside.
Daddy!
Did you see what I just did?
I'm going to do that again!
- Be careful.
- I will!
Hey, did you see it?
Sure I did.
Boo!
Ms. Azuma!
Why are you so surprised to see me?
It's been a while, huh?
Wait, why...
Why are you so upset?
No, I'm not upset, but...
- Did you gain some weight?
- No way! I lost some.
Anyway, why did you quit that job
all the sudden?
I know you ran away from me.
You deleted your SNS account, too.
No, it's not like that, but...
But what? Didn't you expect to
run into each other as we are neighbors?
You're so stupid.
No, I... Oh, that boy must be Ken, right?
Wow, he grew that tall already...
How old is he?
Five.
What are you looking at now?
Huh? Well, I just...
Oh, excuse me.
Hello?
Oh, how have you been?
Well, doing good, but not so busy now.
Oh, sorry. Yes, I'm listening.
Ah... next week?
- Yes, I think next week would work.
- Who is on the phone?
- Tell me who.
- Sorry, can I call you back later?
- Hey, it was a business call.
- Exactly who? Store manager?
- No, it was not. Oh, how is he doing?
- Good, good.
Stop it, please!
It's so loud everybody can hear it!
All you do is watching porno videos
instead of hunting jobs?
Turn down the volume or Aki would wake up.
Put that dirty thing back into pants now.
It's because you don't let me
have sex with you.
By the way, Mr. Yoyogi called me.
He may give me a new job.
It won't happen after all.
I don't trust his words.
Hi there.
Hi, it's been a while.
Yeah. When was the last time?
- It was when I got this plot from you.
- Three years ago, I guess.
I've been worried about you as you haven't
posted anything on your Facebook.
Anyway, as I told you on the phone yesterday,
the president of Sweet Pea is willing to be a
sponsor for the debut of his actress.
I showed your plot to him and he liked it.
He wants you to write the script.
He says the story of a high school girl who makes
udon noodles at hyperspeed is funny and hanky.
Can you write it soon?
Yeah, but...
this is a story set in Kagawa prefecture,
so if I'm writing the script...
Why don't you go there then?
We'll cover the cost
once the script is ready.
How busy are you now?
Are you working on something?
Yeah, a little bit.
Oh, really?
Then, should I look for another writer?
Wait. I think I can manage
to set aside enough time for it.
Then, just do it, please.
Strike while the iron is hot, you know.
Oh, but I haven't got a driver's license.
Go take two or three of your pupils
who can drive with you.
By the way, another big news.
I didn't mention it on the phone,
but your ""Curse in the Village""
seems to progress.
What? For real?
Yeah. They'll start taking the film
by the end of the year.
Here's for you.
Wow, have you printed it already?
""CURSE IN THE VILLAGE""
""Written by Gota Yanagida""
We need to set the cast now.
The director is happy with the script.
This seems to be a sign
that your time is coming.
Oh, Usui. Have you already come?
I had a meeting with Mr. Uchibori
before seeing you.
Hi, how have you been?
- Did you get your hair cut?
- No, I didn't.
Are you working with Uchibori, too?
You are such a popular writer.
They don't pay me well though.
Well, talk to you later.
Mr. Yanagida,
let's have a drink again soon.
He's writing the script
for the new serial drama.
Wow, a serial drama?
Bye.
See you soon.
I'm expecting you to be like him, too.
- So, please write the script ASAP.
- Got it.
- All right, then.
- Thank you for your time.
Usui, let's go have a lunch.
How about grilled eel?
Eel? Again?
- That customer complained a lot.
- Yeah, for over two hours!
- Wish we could get extra money for it.
- Totally.
See you!
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.
Mom, you are slow!
- Oh, my shoe!
- Wait for me! Aki!
""Kijoyu udon,""
""zaru udon,"" oh, ""kamaage udon,""
and ""kamatama udon.""
I want to try this.
""Kagawa Prefecture""
What's ""yudame udon""?
We're home.
Hi, ladies.
How was your day?
If you're home,
why didn't you go pick Aki up?
Sorry, but I didn't expect the meeting
to end that soon.
Hey, why don't we go on a trip to Kagawa?
What?
- Aki, don't turn on the TV so soon.
- Aki, don't!
It's YouTube.
You're getting in my way.
I mean, it's for writing the script.
Remember the plot about
a high school girl making udon?
Some people liked it.
Just go alone. Why should I go with you?
I need someone to drive a car
to go anywhere around there.
And why should it be me?
I'm busy working unlike you!
You're the only one I can ask.
I'm begging you.
They want me to write the script ASAP.
Once it's done, they'll pay me.
Besides, Yumi lives in Shodoshima, helping
her husband's family run a hotel, right?
Why don't you go see her?
And, the place to try some wine...
Here, the winery!
- Don't print in color, I said!
- Sorry.
But, you know,
we can't travel if not on business.
Food looks awesome in Kagawa, too.
So, please come with me.
All you think about is eating.
I could have udon for every meal.
My plot will surely be adopted
for the film this time.
How many times have you said
the same thing to me before?
How about taking Usui with you?
In fact, he seems to be writing a script
for a serial drama now.
- What? For real?
- Yeah, I bumped into him today.
You wasted your time being jealous again,
didn't you?
And you expected me to feel blue like you,
didn't you?
I did feel blue to think that
you involved me.
So, I need to work harder, too, right?
Oh, by the way, I've got a big news!
They seem to start shooting
""Curse in the Village"" by the end of the year!
- Mom, can I have a tea?
- Come get it by yourself.
You're getting in my way, I said!
Like you always say,
I don't want to miss the chance.
Here, look!
What's this?
Don't bring it in front of my face suddenly.
""CURSE IN THE VILLAGE""
Don't let Aki watch TV so much
and go play with her.
Are you mad again?
No, I'm not mad at all.
Mom is great at cooking, isn't she?
Of course, I am.
""Guri and Gura inflated the floating bag.""
""Ready to go. Here we go.""
""It's their first time to go to the sea.""
Read it in more entertaining way.
What? All right...
""Now they're off to the sea.""
""Don't rush, Guri and Gura.""
""Take it easy, all the way to the end.""
""Suddenly, a round head showed up
in the middle of the sea,""
""and said 'Hi there, kind friends.'""
""That was the sea monster.
Guri and Gura waved at him. ""
""The sea monster approached to them
only with one stroke,""
""grabbed the floating bag and said
'Now, enjoy the sea monster swimming.'""
Sorry, did I wake you?
You should wake up early tomorrow for work.
Why don't you come to bed now?
Nobody would read the hand-written one.
Deadline is tomorrow, right?
It's hard for me to use the word processor.
You are not even trying
although I gave this to you.
Actually this is not the word processor.
I would fail again, anyway.
But I like this one.
Especially the title ""Violent Hot Spring.""
This piece would win the prize for sure.
Besides, I am wearing this.
Hey, scratch my back.
Here?
No, go lower.
- Then here?
- Yeah.
- Mom.
- What?
What's wrong?
Did your dad fall asleep before you do?
He is awake.
Dad says he will get the chance
this time no matter what.
- Did he tell you to tell it to me?
- Yes.
Your dad is such a loser.
Why? He said he would do his best.
Come to me.
Mom is fooled by his words a thousand times.
Oh, what should I do? I'm screwed up.
I know he is listening to us up there.
- He is?
- He is.
And now, he went back to the room.
""VIOLENT HOT SPRING""
""Gota Yanagida""
""Merry Home""
Hey, Aki. Hold on.
I'm so sleepy.
Taking local trains is tough for us now.
I woke up at 3 am and made rice balls
while you were still asleep.
Aren't you hungry yet?
Then just eat rice balls.
I won't buy a lunch box for you.
You said you could have udon for every meal.
But you also want to have a beer,
don't you?
No, I don't.
I've got my liquor in this bottle.
I'm trying so hard to save money,
and you should, too.
I even took days off for you.
Stand still, you idiot.
I've got new friends
in locale famous for watermelon
We're very good friends
in locale famous for watermelon
The locale famous for watermelon
is a wonderful place
That beautiful girl is in a pretty dress
in locale famous for watermelon
Yay!
""Meat""
How could you do this to me?
I look terrible.
Don't take a photo!
- The train has gone.
- It's gone.
What could I do? I needed to pee.
- You drink too much.
- Yeah, you drink too much.
Hurry up!
Hey, wait! I'm carrying Aki!
- Where the hell is the train?
- Why?
Platform 2 is the other side.
Wow, it's so beautiful!
What a beautiful sea.
- I want to swim. Can I?
- Yes, you can.
Your mom is more beautiful than the sea,
isn't she?
Just zip up.
The sea is more beautiful.
""Takamatsu Station""
""Takamatsu Station""
Aki, we are in Shikoku now!
- Is here Shikoku? Is it?
- Yes, it is.
You must be hungry, too.
Let's enjoy good foods here.
Have you forgot that you said
you would have udon for every meal.
Let's go. It'll take about 30 minutes
to the hotel on foot.
- On foot?
- Of course!
What?
I'm tired. Carry me.
You can walk, can't you?
- No, not anymore.
- Need to catch up with mom. Let's go.
Carry me.
All right.
Hey, wait up.
I'm hungry.
Tell it to mom.
You tell her.
Hey. Hey, Chika.
What now?
Aki is exhausted now.
Let's get something to eat.
Something? You are the one who said
having udon for every meal would be fine.
I hate how you take the advantage
of the confusion.
Why did you sigh?
You'd better thank me
for coming all the way to Shikoku.
I do.
You sighed because you don't.
I was not sighing but just breathing.
Don't breathe, either.
I would die if I don't.
Then just die.
She is mean, isn't she?
I didn't sigh, but just breathed.
Oh, how about that udon place?
Looks like a pig hut, but who cares?
I hate the way you say it! Wait!
- What?
- Huh?
You just smirked.
Because you had a terrible look on your face.
You did, not me. Asshole.
You call me asshole?
Any place would have worked for me.
Just order something now. I want to
go to hotel soon because I'm exhausted.
All right, then, I'll have ""kake udon.""
You are pretending to be miserable again.
You must have ""kake udon"" only,
not anything else.
Excuse us, can we get middle-sized
""kake udon"" and ""kamatama udon,""
and beer, please?
We don't make ""kamatama udon.""
No liquor here.
- Then, ""bukkake udon"" please.
- Not available.
How about ""zaru udon""?
We serve ""kake udon"" only.
Then, we'll have two ""kake udon.""
Don't smirk like that.
How about Aki?
It's all right.
I'll share with her to save money.
- Right, Aki?
- It costs only 200 yen.
- Do you drink it here?
- Shut up!
I'm hungry, mom.
Don't worry about me, you can just
have it all. We are a poor family.
You always say so, but eat a lot in the end.
That's not true.
You must be talking about dad.
Mom is always the one
to hold back my hunger.
- Udon in Kagawa is so great, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
How can you enjoy eating while I'm not?
But you said you didn't need
to order another one.
Excuse me. One more ""kake udon"" please.
Don't smirk!
Stop right there.
You and Aki are going inside to check in.
I booked one single room only.
What do you mean?
Three of us will stay in a single room.
What? Why?
It works, right?
Isn't it going to be a problem?
That's why I'm telling you to go first.
I'll sneak into the hotel through the back door.
I know you can't do my part.
That's not the point.
Shut up. We do this today only.
We'll stay somewhere different.
For your info, it costs 4.500 yen per night.
For us, it feels like 450.000 yen.
- Hey, where is mom?
- What? Mom?
- Why isn't she coming with us?
- She is staying at home, not coming.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- Here is the room key.
- Got it. Thanks.
Hello? Room number is 502.
Are we really doing this?
The front desk is so small
that they'll find out.
That's why I'm looking for the back door.
The walls are tall and it's too dark to see.
What?
Be careful, then.
Who do you think you are, you idiot!
You are the one who booked this hotel.
- Is mom coming?
- Yeah, later.
Hey, let's take a bath as it's getting late.
- No, I don't want to.
- Listen to me. Come on.
Are you listening to me?
It's time to take a bath.
Aki, hot water is coming out.
I'm coming soon.
Come here now or
I'm going to be scolded by mom.
- Come here!
- Later, I will.
God, I'm going to die.
I've got to change my posture.
Ow!
Shit! I've worn this only twice...
Ouch! God darn it!
Oh, excuse me.
Dad! Hey, dad!
What? Why are you still dressed?
- Somebody is banging the door!
- What? What time is it now?
Stay back.
Huh!? Why the hell are you taking a bath?
Sorry, but...
Do you fucking know what kind of hell
I went through to get here?
How... how did you get here?
Stop mumbling!
I climbed the fucking high wall!
I knew you would be taking a damn bath
or sleeping by now, you shithead!
Lower your voice or people could hear you.
I don't give a shit! Son of a bitch!
- Will you take a bath?
- Sure I will!
- Aki, you've taken a bath already, right?
- Yes, she did!
What's wrong with mom?
What? Oh, nothing.
You shouldn't talk the way she does.
Should I also take a bath now?
Let's go to bed now.
Go ahead, change your cloth.
I'm going to wear this.
All right, you can do that
and watch TV a little more.
In return, you need to tell mom
that you've already taken a bath. Got it?
- Sure.
- For real?
- Yes.
- OK, then change your cloth.
All right.
- Bring me an alcohol from the fridge.
- Got it.
Wow, it's large!
I'm coming now.
- Hurry up and change your cloth now.
- OK.
I'm coming in.
Here you are,
but the drink in the fridge is expensive.
I don't care because
I can't stand without drinking.
Aki is watching TV too much.
Put her in bed now.
I was about to do that
as she's already taken a bath.
Of course, she has!
First of all, you should wear something.
If you get a cold now, I'll kill you.
You fuck-off.
Then...
can I join you?
Why is it getting hard now? Get out of here.
But Aki would see this...
Whatever. Just go away!
Oh, it got soft.
- Here.
- Thank you.
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you.
OK, let's go.
Aki.
We're leaving now.
Aki.
Where are you?
- I'm here.
- Don't play around in the parking lot.
I wasn't playing but hiding.
Please insert the ETC card.
Why?
What's going on?
Are you all right?
Shut up. Don't talk to me
as it's been three years to drive a car.
This should be the one, but why?
Wait... oh, this one.
- Oh, it's moving now.
- It's moving! You're the best.
- Have you buckled up?
- Yes!
- Set the destination if you know how.
- Of course, I can.
- This way?
- No, that way.
All right.
It's the sea! Look outside, mom!
- Just hold on.
- Don't talk to mom while she's driving.
- One, two, test, test. Mike test, one, two.
- Can I borrow it?
Sure. Aki, why don't you sing a song?
- Can I sing ""Locale Famous for Watermelon""?
- Sure.
Oh, hold on.
- I've got new friends...
- It's not working.
Hey, don't break my recorder.
What? You gave this to me.
I'm taking it
because you don't use it at all.
Why? I'm using it.
Well, nobody is using
such an old-fashioned recorder these days.
- Then, don't use it!
- Wait. It hurts!
You look great today, too!
You're the best!
- Guests are watching, so stay back.
- I know, I know.
She is great, isn't she?
- Hey, honey.
- I know, I know!
- Did you take some good pictures?
- Yes, I did.
Surprised to know that
so many people have the same idea.
I can't believe a film and manga
about my daughter will be made.
They'll start shooting the film next month.
So-called media mix.
You learned that media something
just recently, and using it already?
It's a common word.
You know the word ""media sex,"" right?
As you don't know anything,
you should stop talking.
Please join us for lunch.
Both of you can drink, right?
Oh, you need to drive today. I'm sorry!
Stop it now.
It's not a big feast,
but we hope you'll enjoy it.
We'll serve you the udon Nanami made.
My husband was looking forward to having you
so much that went to fishing this morning.
Dad, I saw a big fish jumping in the pond!
Oh, really? Good.
- Dig in, please!
- Thank you.
Go ahead. Do you like this?
How about another round?
Thank you.
Some more water for you.
It tastes better than the water in Tokyo,
doesn't it?
- It tastes the same anywhere.
- It tastes better here!
I envy you for doing a job with freedom.
It's also a family trip for you, right?
Well...
I'm just a normal landowner.
I've got a lot of money but no talent.
However, thanks to Nanami, we feel like
living in a dream to be on TV and films.
Besides,
Yuki Amami is going to play her role.
- It's like a dream, indeed!
- Stop it now. It's embarrassing.
I think Yonekura looks more like me.
Yeah, I agree.
- Will you have another glass of water?
- No, thank you.
Are you sure that they're making
a film and manga about her?
What?
Could you reconsider it?
I think his script would be better.
Hey, wait. What are you talking about?
We heard they are going to start
shooting the film next month.
The director and the crew
were here yesterday, too.
Yeah, we heard so.
Film shooting can be canceled
right before the first day.
There are so many irresponsible companies in
this industry. My husband has experienced it.
- Right, honey?
- Ah, well...
It could happen, right?
It could happen sometimes, but...
if they have already prepared that much,
I think they wouldn't call it off.
Since he watched the news on Nanami, he's
tried so hard to propose his plot for years.
I like his plot a lot.
- You have a confidence, too, right?
- What?
What's that attitude?
It's time for you to sell you to them.
Why are you holding back?
- I'm not holding back.
- You are!
He is always like this and miss the chance.
I always tell him to be more aggressive,
but he can't.
He acts like a king at home,
but becomes soft outside.
I'm sorry to tell this to you,
but I can't help it.
He pretends to be a good man, while yells at
me and talks shit about others at home.
- I hate the way you are!
- Calm down now.
- Why are you telling this to them?
- Because it's true!
They don't know what to do to hear this.
It's a family matter.
- It's not about family, but you!
- I know, but that one, too.
OK, then...
In case the shooting gets postponed,
could you contact me?
What was that? Tell them more clearly.
Why should I always be a bad cop?
- I didn't ask you to.
- It's because you can't say anything.
That's why you can't get a chance.
Excuse me...
Udon is ready.
- Oh, yeah, let's have udon!
- Yes, let's.
- Here's the plates.
- Try some!
It looks great.
Aki, come this way.
- Thank you for everything.
- Have a safe trip.
- Thank you. Take care.
- It's all right.
- Good luck on the film.
- Thank you.
Be nice to each other.
Goodbye.
- Take care.
- Thank you. You, too.
- Thank you for the lunch.
- Be careful on the road.
- Be nice to each other.
- Good luck on the film.
Gosh, it was so disappointing, wasn't it?
I wonder why Mr. Yoyogi said nothing about...
Shut the fuck up. I'm very mad right now.
There was nothing I could do.
I didn't expect this to happen, either.
I don't want to hear your excuse anymore.
You were born to be a loser.
Did we need to come this far?
I bet you just wanted to make a trip
to get away from the reality.
I can't write the script without
actually coming here and feel the air.
Can you tell the difference of the air?
You are just sitting next to me
and using me as your wallet and driver.
Gosh, I am such an idiot to come with you.
I can't believe how fool I am.
I can't stand with it.
Are you arguing with dad?
No, I'm not. I'm just asking him
why he couldn't get his work done.
I took days off to come this far,
and it's become a waste of time.
I don't know why we came here.
Your dad is such a loser.
Bitch, just shut...
Did you just call me a bitch?
You should shut the fuck up. It's irritating
to see you drinking and turning red.
How could I reject having such a big feast
after the interview?
You didn't have an interview with them!
I couldn't turn them down in that situation.
You were eating sashimi, too.
I wasn't!
- You were.
- No, I wasn't.
I saw you having sashimi such as bonitos.
I just wanted to drink, too!
Mom, I feel sick.
- What?
- Are you about to vomit?
- Yes.
- She's about to vomit.
Just do something!
We can't get the rental car dirty.
Get the sick bag there.
Aki, can you hold up a bit longer?
I'll park the car soon.
- No, I can't.
- Wait!
Hold on just a second!
Still feeling sick? Just get it all out.
It's not coming out.
""Yashima's Famous Pottery Throwing""
- Want to keep this?
- Yes.
- Here you are, the water.
- Why did it take so long?
- I feel better now.
- Really?
Great.
Hey, there is an observation deck over there.
- Huh?
- I want to go!
Let's go.
See? The sea looks awesome.
Why do you sound like it's yours?
Do you want to check out the art festival
and see some artworks?
No. I'm going to the hotel now.
I've been driving all day and feel depressed
to have a meaningless day.
Then, let's get some wine at the winery,
get some items for dinner
and have them at the hotel.
Of course, I'll drink.
Is she mad again?
She always is. Don't be like her.
""Welcome to Sanuki Winery""
Are you drinking again?
- I don't like wine though.
- You can't hold your liquor.
Hey, take that guy's attention away from me.
He looks me as if I'm a thief
and it irritates me.
- Why is he staring at you?
- Because I'm a driver, I guess.
Watch him while I pour wine in the bottle.
You should use this.
What am I supposed to do?
What? Are you stealing wine?
Shut up. It's just for tasting. Hurry up!
- What are you doing?
- Shush. Be quiet.
Don't move.
What's that? I want to try, too.
Carry me.
- Dad, please.
- Chika, can you carry her?
It's your job.
I've been carrying her all day.
Here we are.
It looks like a normal apartment
and not quaint.
How could you complain to me?
We are on a trip, remember?
- Wow, it's awesome! Can we live here?
- Wow, it's surprising.
- It costs only 3.500 yen to stay here?
- Yes.
I participated the trial and answered a long
questionnaire to get this offer.
- I tried so hard to find such a good offer.
- Oh, yeah?
I like the white wall, too.
- Let's play sumo.
- Yes, let's!
- Ready?
- Ready, set, fight!
Don't crush this room.
He was so useless today, too.
You won't believe what I'm going to tell you.
It's not that the thighs of my wife
turn me on,
but I was expecting to have sex with her
in this situation.
He was drinking alone and turning red.
You can imagine that, can't you?
Oh, my god. He's come to pour wine.
He is on to something. It's so disgusting.
- No way! I'm tired, too.
- Did you hear what he just said?
""No way! I'm tired, too.""
You never do anything anyway.
What's he talking about?
Once I'm turned on,
I try everything to have sex with her.
I'll bring some liquor with me. See you.
So, I came up with a plan.
Good night
- I'll change the channel.
- Sure.
I can tell you and Yumi are good friends.
You sound very fun to talk with her.
It's good to have a friend like her.
You two are not so sticky and simple
yet have a deep root.
I feel so comfortable to be with Yumi.
She is the best.
I understand. I like her, too.
She was the only person
who agreed with our marriage.
She somehow appreciates you that much.
That's only thing I don't get.
She was a unique girl.
For instance, she liked watching films
directed by Peckinpah.
I'm looking forward to seeing her, too.
- Is her husband coming?
- No, he'll go to work.
Are you joining us tomorrow?
Why don't you go take Aki to the beach?
I want to enjoy the time with her alone.
I'll go to the beach, too, but I bet
she wants to see me, too.
That can't be true. We don't need you.
By the way, you are too close. Go back
to the sofa and stay away from the bed.
Now, what kind of conversation should I have
with her to have sex with her?
It's very hard to figure that out.
By the way, do you remember the weird news?
Which one?
I hear so many weird news every day.
The news about a construction worker
who had been living in the mountain...
and saved a couple who got lost.
Do you know that construction worker
was arrested?
No, I don't and not interested at all.
I don't check the internet all day long
like you do.
Well, what I heard is this.
That old guy couldn't stop himself...
but to fuck her
while he was taking care of her.
- So?
- What?
What's the point?
Well, I wonder what her boyfriend was doing
at that time.
What do you mean?
I mean...
while the old man was fucking her.
What's your point? You're so disgusting.
Do you think he was listening to them
and enjoying it?
You watch porno too much.
I can imagine you would do so.
Anyway, it's boring
to hear the story like that. What a waste.
I'm going to bed.
Shall I massage you? I still owe you some
for losing the UNO match.
Forget about it. It's been over 10 years.
Let me massage you for 30 minutes, please.
I know you're exhausted to drive all day.
You are poor at massaging.
Besides, you owe me much more,
like 30 hours. You're such a liar.
I know. I'm going to do it better.
Leave me alone. I'm telling you,
I'm not going to have sex with you.
Who said anything about having sex?
But why don't we do it? We are on a trip.
- No.
- Why?
Because I don't want to.
Why not? Let's make love.
It's a special occasion.
No. I want to sleep because I'm tired.
Then, let me lie next to you like this.
You're so annoying.
Chop!
You're the worst man. You became
violent if not getting to have sex.
It's August 6th.
I've come all the way to Kagawa prefecture
to do research for writing the script.
I couldn't have an interview nor
have sex with my wife.
So, I'm feeling lost,
wandering the city in Takamatsu.
I thought about picking up a prostitute,
but didn't have a courage to steal money
from my wife's money.
That bitch. Pig!
Pig! Bitch! Pig!
Forgive me for texting you.
When I saw you last time after a long time,
I think I felt excited a little bit.
Sorry. You don't need to reply to me.
Because it's going to hurt.
Oh, well. Whatever. I sent it already.
Excuse me?
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
Oh, I just dropped some coins.
- How much?
- Well, ah...
- She looks very sick.
- Yeah.
Wow, she must have drunk a lot.
Are you all right?
- Do you know her?
- What?
I said ""Do you know her?""
No, I don't, but...
Can I see your ID, please?
- Huh?
- Your ID.
I don't have my ID because I'm on a trip.
- From where?
- What?
From Tokyo.
Then, come with me to the police station.
I want to talk with you.
- What?
- Now, wake up.
It's dangerous to sleep in a place
like here. Wake up.
- Hey, you.
- Me?
Take that bicycle and follow me.
- What?
- Come one, hurry up.
Hey! I said hurry up!
Are you out of your mind to call me
such early in the morning?
I've got a small child to take care of.
Besides, what were you doing outside?
Go to hell!
Tell me your name so that
I can file a claim about you!
Sorry, but we're just doing our jobs.
Your husband was taking care of a drunk lady.
- I don't give a shit!
- I'm so sorry.
Here is your driver's license.
You can go now.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Did you hear me? I'm sorry.
I was just taking care of her,
and he misunderstood me. What a bad luck.
I'll carry Aki.
By the way, what were you doing out there?
As I came up with the idea for the script,
I went out for a walk...
I knew you were feeling stressed
not to have sex.
Carry her now.
- Besides, I remembered something terrible.
- What?
- When I saw you at the police station...
- Huh?
When I noticed that I was pregnant
and told you about it,
you turned blue
as if it was the end of the world.
What?
That's the face I'm talking about!
Oh, my god.
You made me pregnant because you wanted
the excuse to give up on films.
- I know that.
- What? Why are you telling me this now?
Because the look on your face
brought me back old memories!
Having a baby is a good excuse
for giving up on your dream.
But you were the one who wanted a baby.
It didn't need to be your baby.
When I asked you to break up,
you started to be willing to have a baby.
I remember how upset you were.
But you didn't change a big
even after Aki was born.
You stayed the same:
self-centered, childish idiot.
Wait, calm down.
I wonder why I didn't break up with you
at that time.
But I worked part-time
while you were on maternal leave.
It's nothing to brag about.
I asked you to keep that job, but you quitted
anyway for some mysterious reason.
I had some issue in relationships.
Issues in relationships exist in any jobs.
It may be true, but...
Look! ""Curse on the...""
""Curse in the Village"" would become a film!
It's going to be a game changer.
How many times have you told
such thing to me?
It's not going to be real.
I should have broken up with you
at that time.
I knew you were a loser.
Stop acting like that now.
You've been displeased since you got here.
That's wrong. I've been like that
ever since you came into my life.
You don't make money
but complains and eat a lot.
- You loser.
- Hey, don't talk like that in front of Aki.
I might have become a real loser
because you kept saying so to me.
Don't blame me for being a loser
having no talent.
Then, since you chose to be with a loser,
you are a loser, too!
That's right. I'm a loser, too.
But I'm better than you.
You are almost a garbage: a spitbox!
Don't spit at me. Disgusting.
Is that all you got to say?
You deserve to be spat at.
Just go away and never come back!
Shut up! Shall I start recording
to show you how ugly your voice is?
Go do it. Then what?
You can't even have an interview.
Nobody is using such an old recorder
these days. You loser.
Th... this is your recorder!
Why are you mumbling? You're so uncool.
Besides, in fact, you have nothing
that you want to write about.
All you want is to be famous and popular.
That's why you stay being a loser.
That's enough.
Did you kick me? How scary.
You chopped me earlier, too.
You kick me because you can't use your hands?
How scary.
A loser like you will
start to get more violent.
So uncool.
Nobody in the universe can be more uncool.
I don't want you around any longer.
Go to hell!
I'll get a drink and go see Yumi.
Give me back my wallet, you thief!
Why are you losing your temper?
So uncool.
Go to hell, you pig!
Shut up! Pick up all the coins!
Hey, dad. Wake up. Dad!
- Dad.
- Huh? What?
Mom isn't home yet.
- What time is it now?
- I don't know. Where is mom?
Ow. Just wait.
- When will she come back?
- I'm going to the bathroom.
Where is mom?
Dad, your pee is off the toilet bowl.
It's all right because it's not ours.
- I'll tell it to mom!
- Don't.
You sounded like a mean girl. Just stop.
- Will you call mom?
- Well...
She is busy doing something today.
So, how about going to the beach with me?
Are we going to island? Taking a ship?
- I don't know about island.
- Let's go to island by a ship! Yay!
I always feel sick on the ship though.
- Are you texting mom?
- Don't look!
Go pack your stuff now.
- What?
- Hurry up. Now.
All right.
What should I pack?
You want to have sex with me again,
don't you?
It's so obvious. So irritating.
But I may want to do the same, too.
So irritating.
Any man would want to have sex with
a hot lady like you.
You should forgive me.
You should forgive me.
Hey, dad! Look!
I might fall! If I fall, I could die!
It's dangerous. Don't fall.
Dad, is that the island? Shodoshima?
That's right. Mom is there, too.
But Aki and I can't join her.
It's so unfair, isn't it?
She is doing something fun alone.
You should tell this to your grandma.
Boo!
- Are you texting mom?
- It's my client.
Aki! Don't run out into the street!
Wait for me, Aki!
Excuse me, but how far is
this Healthy Beach from here?
It'll take about 10 minutes by bus.
Since the previous one just left,
you need to wait for an hour.
Then, can we go there by that rental bicycle?
I don't know, but I think you'd get there
sooner than the next bus.
There is a slope on the way though.
Dad, I've got better at riding a bicycle.
Yes, indeed. You've got better.
Dad, wait for me.
If I stop, I wouldn't be able to ride again.
Come on.
Hey, dad.
I'm tired.
Dad, are you listening to me?
I'm tired.
I'm tired, too!
You said you wanted to go to the beach.
Stop crying. I want to cry, too.
Let's go now.
It's not funny at all! He is a real loser.
He hasn't changed at all. I bet he was
trying to do something to the drunk lady.
I should have let them arrest him.
Getting caught as a groper
is perfect for him.
He is a real loser.
- You are so harsh as always.
- No, I'm not!
Dad, look! I made a mountain.
Yeah.
Look!
Dad, look!
""To Ms. Azuma
I want to touch your marshmallow...""
""Incoming Call From Ms. Azuma""
I made a mountain.
Hello?
Yeah, it's easier to talk on the phone.
- Dad, look!
- I was really surprised to bump into you.
Well...
No, no. I didn't run away from you.
Dad, I made a mountain!
I couldn't get to work as often
as I used to do, so...
It's true.
He was such a promising writer
in the college.
He used to be a star of the cinema club,
winning a prize for his script.
That was the highlight of his life.
The club was so silly, anyway.
I wanted to see Gota, too.
Why don't you call him now
and make it up with him?
No way. He'll start complaining you about me.
I don't care. I want to see Aki, too.
Taking a day off is so rare
for a landlady like me.
- I'll call him.
- No, please don't. Yumi!
Yeah, I was so excited to see you.
I thought you might be able to
hear my heart racing.
Yeah. It is racing now, too.
Do you want to hear?
What? Yeah, it's fine for me.
Tomorrow? Ah...
I won't be in Tokyo tomorrow.
Yes, on a business trip.
Yeah.
Next Wednesday?
It works for me.
Then, as always,
shall we go there afterwards?
What?
Well, to be honest with you,
mine is getting so hard right now.
Ms. Azuma! Somebody might see us.
Nobody would.
Go ahead, take off your shirt!
I know you like a play like this.
- I'm feeling embarrassed.
- Are you?
Why's that? Tell me.
Talk to me.
- I'm embarrassed.
- Louder!
- I'm embarrassed!
- Tell me more.
I'm embarrassed to be like this at the dump!
I can feel precum is already coming out.
I'm about to come.
It's your fault, Ms. Azuma.
You are responsible for this.
Yes, you are.
You should get ready for this.
I won't stop even if you cry.
I want to be infatuated with your body.
Yes.
OK, see you on Wednesday.
Bye.
Aki?
Aki!
- I can hear the call at last.
- Just hang up now.
But he doesn't answer.
He must be sleeping at the hotel,
letting Aki watch TV all day long.
Aki! Aki!
Aki, where are you?
Aki, where did you go?
Aki!
Dad!
There you are. Where have you been?
- Are you her father?
- Yes, I am. Sorry.
- Keep your eye on her. It's dangerous.
- I'm sorry.
At the beach,
children often get involved in accidents.
These days, I see many parents
who don't keep their eye on their kids.
The beach is full of danger.
Got it.
Glad to find your father.
Hey, Aki. You should stay with me
at the beach. It's very dangerous.
I'm sorry.
Do you want to have shaved ice?
All right, then.
In return, you should promise me
not to go away from me.
- You should be more careful.
- OK.
Oh, watch out.
I don't want to be scolded again, OK?
What's going on?
He must be a bad father.
""Incoming Call From Chika""
Hello?
Sit down to eat.
Who is this?
Oh, Yumi! It's been a while.
I wanted to see you, too,
but I'm on the beach with my daughter.
Yeah.
In fact, we are in Shodoshima now.
Do you know Healthy Beach?
By a rental bicycle?
Wow, it must have been a lot of work.
Why don't you join us?
Don't call him over.
He'll get too excited to be invited.
It's all right.
I'll pay for the cab, so please come over.
Really? Then, we'll be coming.
Yes, all right.
I'll call you. Bye.
Are we going to see mom?
Yeah, so, I'll buy you another shaved ice.
In return, can you keep that you got lost
at the beach a secret?
Sure. I'll have a strawberry flavor.
- OK. Can you really promise?
- Yes.
- Then, I'll get it.
- Yay!
She is so cute.
I should get my husband checked, too.
Yeah, you should. Just get his sperm
at home and take it to the hospital.
Gota's one was said to be so weak.
It was almost dead.
I can imagine that.
Will you have another child?
No way. We can't afford it.
I would like another one though.
How can we afford it?
You are not thinking about anything.
Director Kuroiwa says having one and
two children are the same thing.
He is a rich man unlike you.
Don't get influenced by others
on a topic like this.
But he does all the housework, right?
All he can do is to take Aki to and from
the day-care center.
I prepare meals, too.
You do?
Yeah. I'm good at cooking, right?
He relies on the recipe online.
He is good at imitating people's work.
I don't imitate people's script!
I know you imitated someone's script and
worried about being found out.
You kept asking me what I thought.
So, I told you that it's almost the same,
you were so upset.
You lost your temper and yelled
""Can't you see it's an homage?""
Do you remember yelling at me like that?
It's fun to watch them, isn't it?
Why don't you also write scripts
for TV dramas to earn some money?
Most of them are silly.
Yeah, if I had a chance.
He says he doesn't want to write for TV
although he doesn't get any offer.
- I don't say that.
- Yes, you do.
Except for Taichi Yamada and So Kuramoto,
all the writers are shit, you said.
I give credit to Kankuro Kudo, too.
Who do you think you are?
You are the lowest shit.
No, lower than shit.
I'm getting irritated again.
Calm down, Chika.
Gota, will you take a nap?
I heard you couldn't sleep last night.
You can use the guest room.
- Really? Then, can I?
- Sure.
Once she starts complaining, it never ends.
- Come this way.
- You always run away.
- Let's go.
- Yes.
He'll start thinking about something naughty
if you are too kind to him.
I don't care if it's him.
Sorry for forcing you to come over.
Chika is harsh on you as always, isn't she?
No, no. She is harsher at home.
All right, then, enjoy fantasizing
as much as you want.
What? Yumi...
- See you later.
- Thank you.
That little devil, jeez.
Oh, Yumi!
I'm always the one to seduce him.
I want a baby for sure,
but sometimes, I just want to get laid.
I know he's been busy working all day long,
but it takes a courage to seduce him, too.
Really? Are you still interested
in having sex?
You are not anymore?
Not at all. Especially since Aki was born.
Isn't it sad to be sexless
after having a baby?
It's nothing to do with Aki.
He is simply not attractive as a male.
Although he doesn't make any money,
he has a big mouth,
quibbles, kowtows and yells at me.
I can't stand with him anymore.
But it'll work out as long as
he wants to have sex with you.
- Once it starts, it ends soon anyway.
- Well, yeah. That's true.
But he says something unnecessary
with a grin on his face.
What does he say?
Such as ""It's been a while."" and
""You're sensitive today.""
It's so disgusting that I get turned off.
He always wants me on top and do nothing
but asks me to do a lot.
It doesn't last a minute once it starts.
- Well, but sooner is better.
- That's for sure.
Besides, he sometimes loses his temper.
He says ""Nobody would want
to have sex with you besides me!""
""I'll never fuck you again!""
""Our relationship is working because
I still want to have sex.""
In the end, he says
""I'll go fuck someone else.""
He just likes it.
But you don't break up with him
because you trust him, don't you?
No, I don't.
I expect nothing from him. He is so hopeless.
Then, are you interested in having sex with
somebody else than him?
I've seen a cool father
at the day-care center,
but I've forgotten how to gasp.
Don't worry, you'll remember.
I remembered it right away.
What do you mean?
- Tell me what's going on.
- Well...
- Tell me.
- Promise me to keep this a secret.
I will. So, tell me.
What's going on?
In fact,
I have a boyfriend.
For real? Hush, I could wake Aki.
Who is it?
He is a part-time worker at our hotel.
He is a college student and very cute.
What? How did it start?
I don't know, but it just happened.
Wow. You haven't changed.
When I was working, he suddenly kissed me.
He was so aggressive.
I bet you flirt with him first.
I'm not good at hiding my true feelings.
Whatever.
Wait, does it mean
he is your friend with benefits?
No, he is not. He is my boyfriend.
It's so awesome to hear naughty things
from a young boy like him.
He makes me feel like I'm falling
and it really turns me on.
You are actually falling.
But I know you want to try it, too.
Huh? No way! I'm shocked!
I doubt that because you are overreacting.
- I'm not!
- You are.
- I agree with Yumi.
- No, I'm not!
She is overreacting and it stinks.
It looks like Chika is excited.
Yumi's stimulus confession
must have turned her on
and her vagina must be so wet now.
Perhaps, tonight,
I may be able to have sex with her.
What?
Nothing. Did you have fun seeing Yumi
for the first time in years?
Yes, I did.
Really.
What were you talking about
while I was asleep?
Nothing special.
I think Yumi has become beautiful.
She was born to be beautiful.
In order to make Chika remember
the story of Yumi and her boyfriend,
I brought this up.
But she's become more beautiful than before.
Do you think it's because she consumes
the essence of Seto Inland Sea?
I don't know. I think it's thanks to
her awesome husband.
I'm sorry.
For what?
For not being an awesome husband.
Besides, I couldn't do anything
although you came with me all the way.
It's all right now.
Not everything is your fault.
What?
It's working! It's working well.
I... I'll do my best to be awesome.
What's wrong?
I'll really do my best.
I've thought that I want to be a good husband
for you since I met you.
You'd better be so that
I don't need to get irritated.
It's up to men whether women will become
more beautiful or not.
She sounds turned on.
You're right. I'll do my best to be awesome.
Please do so.
Hey, Chika.
I want to make love with you tonight.
Oh, well...
Fine. Tonight is exceptional.
- I knew it!
- What do you mean?
Nothing.
Then, I'll try being Benicio Del Toro tonight.
You don't have to. I know you can't.
How about Koichi Sato?
I prefer Koji Yakusho tonight.
That's a good choice.
But you can stay just as you are.
You don't need to imitate Jennifer Lawrence.
Of course, I don't.
By the way, stop smirking like that.
It turns me off.
Just in case, I brought this.
Are you an idiot? Aki may wake up.
Well... I feel shy because it's been a while.
Don't say that. It turns me off, too.
I'll make you feel so good.
Shut up now.
- I can gasp, can't I?
- Shut up.
- You make me gasp.
- I said, shut up.
Hey, it's tickling.
- What? You're using it too soon.
- Don't worry, I got this.
No, you don't. It's too soon.
- Donât be lazy.
- Oh, come on. You're all ready.
After having good sex, everything goes well
between us, doesn't it?
Stop saying such things. It turns me off.
So, let's make love once a week at least.
For building a better relationship.
Once a week is too much.
I am infatuated with your body.
I've got some fat around my stomach though.
I love it this way. I'm a maniac.
It's unnecessary for you to say so.
Ow! It's hot!
- It's not hot. Don't overreact.
- It is hot.
- One, two...
- I'll watch you do it here.
What? Wait!
- Look at the camera.
- Yay!
...three!
Wow.
That's unique.
Aki, wait for us.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Now, say cheese.
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.
We appreciate it. Thanks.
- Have a safe trip.
- Thanks, you too. Bye.
I'm Chika Yanagida from Nerima Ward, Tokyo.
I wish my husband will succeed in his career.
I'm counting on you.
Please make my wish come true.
Mom!
There she is.
- Take a photo of us.
- I am taking it!
Did you see how dad did?
Yes, he hurt his hip.
Ready, set, go!
Mom is slower than dad!
I wish I could earn enough money
to let Aki have sushi once a month.
What about me?
You should think about me first.
Needless to say,
I want to let you have sushi every day.
Then, try harder.
I'm tired of being worried about money.
I know. I'll try harder.
- Can I have another medium-fatty tuna?
- All right, medium-fatty tuna!
Medium-fatty tuna!
Again? How many of them
have you ordered today?
It's all right. Just for today.
- Oh, hey.
- What?
Once the film of ""Curse in the Village"" is out,
let's make another trip.
- How about going abroad?
- Sounds great.
I knew ""Curse in the Village""
would be successful.
It was fun to read the script.
I was impressed.
- I preferred it to the original book.
- Really?
You were telling me
""It's not going to be real."" earlier.
Why do you bring it up now?
- That's why you are an idiot.
- I didn't mean to upset you.
Imagine how hard it was to write it
based on the boring book.
It took three years to see
the printed script.
Yeah. You did a great job.
Why don't you write a novel?
I think you can do better than others.
Yeah, I've been thinking about it, too.
Go ahead and write it. If it becomes a film,
you could write the script.
It'll work better. If you become popular,
I will be your manager.
I want to direct the film by myself, too.
Most of the directors and producers
are fools, you know.
They can't even read the script
and drive me nuts.
Yeah, you should do everything by yourself.
I've been telling you so, haven't I?
It's Mr. Yoyogi!
Here it comes!
He would offer you a new job.
Hello? How are you?
Dad said he would try harder
to let Aki have salmon roe more often.
Here medium-fat tuna is.
Yes, I heard
they will start shooting next month.
Yeah.
Well, I'll come up with another plot soon.
Something funny and hanky.
Right.
No, no. I'm not disappointed at all.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it.
All right, I'm looking forward to
your new plot.
Thank you! I'll do my best.
By the way, I have one more news to break.
Your script is turned down. What was it?
Oh, ""Curse in the Village.""
What?
The original author complained
about your script.
So, I got upset and gave up
arguing with him.
You'll be surprised to know
what your dad is capable of.
Can I have another one
at room temperature, please?
You can hold your drink!
How attractive you are.
Stop it.
I really like this one.
It's fruity and has a good flavor.
- I'm so happy to be here.
- I bet you are.
- Bring another Koshi no Kaiten to the counter.
- OK!
What's that look on your face?
He said ""Curse in the Village"" has....
What?
My... my script has...
Hold on!
What? Will Fukuyama be on the film?
My script has been turned down.
Are you kidding?
Why? I'm not following you.
I'm not sure, either.
Why don't you get it?
Please... don't yell at me.
I'm not yelling! What exactly did he say?
Well...
The original author didn't like my script.
I don't know why, but...
What happened?
I feel so hopeless now.
He said there was no problem with my script
and the director liked it, too.
If so, why doesn't he try harder
to persuade the original author?
I'd been telling Mr. Yoyogi...
that he should show my script
to the original author in advance.
But he said ""Don't worry. I'll persuade
the author if he complains about it.""
- He always...
- Stop talking.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Why?
Why do things never work out?
Here is Koshi no Kaiten.
Let me take these away.
Mom, are you all right?
Hey, Chika. Don't cry.
Even in this situation
you are self-conscious?
Thank you. I'm all right.
I feel better now because you stroke my back.
- Excuse us. Check, please.
- Certainly.
- Bring a check to the counter!
- All right!
- Are we leaving now?
- I don't feel like drinking anymore.
Aki, come with me.
Hey.
Chika, wait.
Don't touch me!
Break up with me.
What?
I can't do this anymore.
Wait, calm down. It's so sudden...
No, it's not!
I've asked you so many times!
Yeah, but hold on. Why...
This is it.
I can't take it anymore.
I really can't.
I don't know what to do.
Just hold on and calm down.
I am calm now.
You'll never try hard
as long as I'm with you.
You are making both me and Aki unhappy.
I don't want to keep on doing this anymore.
I really have no idea what to do.
Why...
I've tried so hard for such a long time.
Hey, mom. Are you all right?
But you...
Why?
I was expecting the script to be used
for the film and it would change something.
I thought you might not be a loser.
But you...
You are just scared to be alone!
Mom. Please stop crying.
Sorry, Aki.
I don't want to cry, either, but...
But I want to cry now.
Stop crying.
Please don't cry.
- Please don't cry.
- I'm sorry. Sorry, Aki.
I... I'm trying hard, too!
But... it doesn't work out at all!
I don't know what to do!
I want to cry, too!
Shut up!
Shut up and don't cry.
You don't deserve to cry! Don't cry!
Because I... I'm trying hard, too...
Shut up and don't cry!
Why do you sound so pathetic?
I'm done with your stupid act!
Don't yell at dad anymore!
Because...
he is such a stupid dad!
Stay away from us!
Don't cry nor laugh!
You don't deserve to cry nor laugh!
Don't laugh!
Go to hell!
Eat shit and die!
Why are you crying and laughing
at the same time?
Why, mom?
I'm so tired now.
Don't laugh! Stop it, you idiot!
I'm so tired of this.
Why are you laughing?
""Good-Luck Red Pants""
""Good-Luck Red Pants""
Let's get some.
What? I don't need it.
You are trying harder than anybody else.
All you need is a good luck.
Let's do whatever we can do.
I'll wear this, too.
Will you, too?
Good luck won't come to you
if I don't wear it, right?
Yeah, but... I'm not sure about this.
I don't like
""praying to the gods"" kind of stuff.
I'll take this one. How do I look?
- You look like Giant Baba.
- Really?
Look how high-waisted it is.
This piece would win the prize for sure.
Besides, I am wearing this.
I'll do my best.
I'll do my best for sure.
I promise you.
I'll do my best for sure.
I... ah...
I love you.
""Gota Yanagida""
""Merry Home""
- I can't read your hand-writing.
- What?
- Which one?
- This one.
This one is...
Oh, it's ""jack ass.""
How's it going?
- Here you are.
- I don't need tea but beer, you idiot!
You need beer?
- It's funny, isn't it?
- No. It's normal.
Normal?
What? Which part was funny for you?
Hold on. What's this?
Ow, it hurts.
""I'm not going to take it...""
What did you write here?
Give me a second.
""I'm not going to take it...""
- ""because I won't use it.""
- What?
Oh, ""because I won't use it at all.""
Why don't you write ""at all""
in Chinese characters?
Sorry, but...
you sounded like a young punk.
Yeah, I know.
""Because I...""
- ""won't use it...""
- ""at all.""
Why did you sigh?
I was not sighing but just breathing.
Don't breathe, either.
I would die if I don't.
Then just die.
Wow, really?
I'm going to live!
- I'm going to live!
- Enough!
Don't put them here.
Leave me alone now.
Don't interfere with my work.
There should be at least one part
that you liked.
Something normal can't be sold to them.
So, tell me which part you liked.
Who do you think you are?
Because you just say it's normal.
I'm not saying it's bad.
So, you should appreciate it.
Nobody would buy a normal book.
Do you really need to tell it to me now?
I'm busy.
Oh, sorry. I can't thank you enough.
- Who do you think you are?
- Go back to work.
Can you type it if I don't?
No, I can't, and I'm grateful to have you.

come on up, step up.
Will you marry me?
âª Never ever give up âª
Uh, I don't know.
- Thank you so much.
- Nice job.
Nice job girls,
nice job, nice job.
Yeah really, really nice, Pearl.
Nice, buddy.
Shocking,
yeah I'm surprised.
God Pearl, what did you do?
I felt like a little change.
A little?
Oh, okay I got a
little carried away, but,
Emergency makeover
time, let's go, girls.
You good?
Oh yeah, yeah.
I'm always up for a little
conversation though.
So...
You think they'll
notice the new hair?
Notice what?
Did you do something different?
Oh, you got a different shirt.
Okay, hahaha.
But no, just this past year,
with all the changes, you know,
new stepdad, siblings,
cool new grandpa.
I just felt very stuck.
Well, I love it.
I love it too.
You know, it's sophisticated.
Still says, I'm a rock star.
Well, nobody's gonna notice
anything till tomorrow.
With all that construction
back in Pennsylvania,
we'll make it in
about three a.m.
That sucks.
Now I'm so excited to
see Mom's new baby bump.
Like, tour has been amazing
and very, very surreal, but,
it's just funny how four
months ago I thought
I was going to lose my mind.
But all this time
away is really,
I've really been missing them.
Well the heart embraces
all kinds of love.
Please tell me that's
from your TV show.
Maybe.
But just because
something isn't real
doesn't mean it isn't true.
I like that one.
Hey.
McCartney, wake up.
I need you to drive me.
What?
Wake up.
Oh, we're home.
Robert!
Oh,
okay, oh, okay oh.
Mmm.
11 days is way too long.
Okay, Stefani, Stefani, dear,
I missed you, I did,
but we're in public
and it's late so
let's get you home.
Hello, Bob.
Bye guys!
Why does your friend
insist on calling me Bob?
Little Phil.
Pearl, hey, I'm
so glad you're here.
Hi.
How was the tour?
I can't believe you
went with Dr. Bunsen.
I'm so shocked.
Yeah, it was amazing.
And you'll get to
see Sam again soon.
He really liked you.
Really?
I made a fool of
myself at the wedding.
He's used to
fools, Uncle Adam.
I mean he hangs out at
our house all of the time.
You remember Janis and Miles?
They came down to help,
and my friend Stef.
That's great.
I hear you had some
computers donated
that you need some work on?
Yes, and if I'm not mistaken
I believe you might
be able to help us out
with the kids, a
little bit of dance.
Looks like you
inspired these kids
to free weekend dancing
in dance, art, maybe
some STEM classes
and music lessons?
Ladies?
Yeah, yeah, no problem.
We can kind of give
them an overview
for the first six weeks
and then they can specialize
however they want.
My mom's meeting
with an arts group
about a supply of
used instruments.
I can help with drums if
I'm not to busy with ASL.
This is so awesome.
How about a tour, come on.
There.
I think that should do it.
We have a well-oiled
back to school machine.
Everybody's getting
along with each other.
It is not.
My side is so pretty.
Your side of the room looks
like a chicken barfed in it.
Mine looks like a
unicorn decorated it
with its own two hands.
Do you know what's
funny about that?
No.
Unicorns don't have hands.
They have hooves.
But they could just magic
themselves a pair of hands.
You make an excellent point.
I could help you
sparkle up your side.
All right, slow down.
I'll think about that.
Nice.
I mean, nice job, ladies.
It's good to get help if
you aren't good at things.
Right, Dad?
Mom taught me that.
That's right.
She was super smart
just like you.
I know.
It's also important
to keep a good attitude.
Don't get down when you fail.
Yeah, I mean,
you only have one life to live
and you gotta give
it all you got.
Yeah, I learned that from you.
You don't give up even
when you fail really bad.
Well, yeah, but,
what do you mean?
Well you know how you're
really bad at making breakfast
but you still try anyway
and keep a good attitude?
I think that's cool.
Well, everybody else
really likes my breakfast.
Yeah, you're doing so great.
But my super duper
chocolate chip waffles?
Mhmm, they're the bomb, boom.
Sorry, dude, but, no.
Well, I wouldn't say that.
I mean they are better than
his cheesy corn chip potatoes.
Don't get
me started on those.
Meanies!
We're just
trying to help.
Poor baby.
Come to mama.
One second.
Hi.
Can I help you?
No, I think we're good.
I'm Aiden Neville.
I believe you know
my brother Paul?
Yeah, I believe he's
one of our landlords
along with the Kings.
Yes, the Kings.
Well the Kings were actually
thinking about selling us
half this building,
and we're looking to
make a few improvements.
Good, we have lots of plans
and I'm really sorry
to see the Kings move.
The Kings have been so kind.
I'm sorry to see them move.
Yes, yes, I'm sure you are.
Anyway, I think we can
handle this by ourselves.
All right.
Hey, Miles, isn't
that Miss Anderson?
Oh man, I had her
for 10th in science.
Yeah.
That's weird.
Maybe she's here teaching
STEM classes after school.
I'm gonna say hi.
Miss Anderson?
Hi, it's me Miles.
Miles Bennett and
Stefani Spencer.
My, what a small world.
What brings you here?
Miles.
This is my fiancee,
Paul Neville.
He owns this building.
He owns hundreds actually.
And his brother Aiden.
Not hundreds, dear,
but our company owns 87.
Well, congratulations
on getting engaged.
Thank you.
Thanks.
I've got myself quite the catch.
You could do better.
Are we ready?
Yeah, I think so.
Hi, I'm Stefani Spencer.
âª Each one of us children
has so much to say âª
âª We weather the
sunshine and the rain âª
âª Seasons of heartache,
seasons of change âª
âª Somehow we still remain âª
âª We are not alone âª
âª Truth will mend the soul âª
See you
next Wednesday.
Adios!
Bye bye, bye bye.
Oh, my bad.
- See you next Wednesday.
- Bye.
Bye, kids.
The feedback that I'm getting
from parents is awesome.
Please tell me you
guys can stay on
for another six weeks?
Yeah, no, that
shouldn't be a problem.
But I'll need to take the
weekend off before finals
because I'm beyond hope.
I'm in.
Me too.
I think I'm enjoying
this more than the kids.
Stef?
Oh.
I'm not sure.
Robert's a senior
now and his family
is launching a new line.
He's gonna need me for
a lot of weekend events.
I can't really commit, but,
I can help whenever I can.
Okay.
- Maybe Car or Haley can help.
- Yeah, sure.
You're never gonna
wanna touch me again.
I highly doubt that.
I don't get it.
How am I a woman
with the 14 children
and there are things
about pregnancy
that I didn't know about?
You know, I think you
could lay off the baby books.
No, no.
Seriously, like
three months from now
I'm going to be a
bloated, gassy sasquatch.
No, no, with bad breath
and literally splitting
apart at the seams.
Ooh, episiotomy chapter huh?
You knew about this
and never told me?
Well, I have been
patiently waiting 43 years
to exact my revenge.
You know, about that
three months thing,
I was thinking,
if there was a way that
we could just squeeze,
just a little bit extra,
maybe do some yoga poses,
and have the baby this year,
that would be tax deduction
for this whole year.
Yeah?
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah,
that's fine with me.
But you're gonna have
to talk to the guy.
Ooh.
Mom, you were right.
I should have done this
when I was younger.
Mother knows best.
- Sometimes.
- Grandma?
Yes dear?
Can I have a twick?
You do mean Twix,
don't you dear?
No, I only want one.
That makes sense.
But I
want the other one.
Do you think
that's wise, dear?
You are getting a little
thick around the middle.
I'm pregnant, mom.
Yes, dear.
Pregnant, at your age.
There should
seriously be some kind
of karmic law against
pregnancy, puberty, and dementia
in the same house.
Billie?
Don't forget to get the
candy this time, okay?
Okay, I won't.
All right.
Why don't we get the day
after Halloween off school?
It's one of the most
important holidays for kids.
I hear you buddy.
But it's not really a holiday.
Jeez, how can I be expected
of playing volleyball
after eating 25 candies?
And I gotta roll
to school chubby!
What can I say,
life isn't fair.
B, your costume
is slowing us down.
To the next house.
Come on, ladies.
Excuse me, but we
need water refilled.
Oh I'm just heading over
to the table over here.
We've been waiting
for 10 minutes.
Chop-chop, Lucy Liu.
I don't,
What was that about?
I have no idea.
I swear they were about to
ask me about homework next.
Oh my god, and you're
terrible at math.
Anyways,
this is Cole, my dad.
Hi,
- nice to meet you.
- Hi, call me Laura.
Hi, Laura.
And I want you guys to meet
the head of A&R, John Gresh.
Nice to meet you.
It's really cool that you're
coming through Michigan.
No, it's an honor to meet you.
We are huge fans
and can't wait to work
with you on your first EP.
Sorry that her mom
couldn't make it today but
well, we're excited to be here.
No worries.
You might even know the
reason why we're here.
You know our biggest artist
is playing the Star tonight.
Are you a fan of Logan French?
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.
He's got a really cool image.
Yeah, well, we've
got a surprise for you.
Logan is joining us.
He's heard your work and
he wants to meet you.
That's so flattering.
I mean, we have very
different sound.
No, no, no, see.
See that's why we
wanted you two to meet.
Logan does an amazing
job of adapting his style
to what's commercially
successful.
And you know, Laura
kind of told me
you're struggling a
little bit with that.
So we thought he could help.
Well that's
very generous of him.
Ooh,
he's here already.
Oh my god, you're
Logan French.
Yeah, how are you?
I listen to your
album every morning.
Thank you so much,
I appreciate that.
Can I get a picture with you?
Yeah, of course.
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you so much.
You too.
Hey guys.
I'm probably one of
the only morning people
in the music industry.
I'm karmically punctual.
I see, tonally different.
Logan, this is Pearl Song.
Your songs are really dope.
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
And you're one bop Love Club,
it's really burning
up the charts.
And we thought you two
would spend a little time
talking music while we're
gonna go over timetables
and contract with Dad, okay?
Well there's a music
store across the street
and I have to get guitar
strings anyway if you wanna hang
and jam out a bit?
Yeah, I'd really like that.
Cole, is this cool?
Yeah.
Sure, as long as Logan knows
there's a MMA champ sitting
across the street, that's cool.
Don't worry, sir.
If I don't fear for my life,
you're sitting with the people
who have my career
in their hands.
Yeah, right.
So, lead the way.
Okay yeah.
Gotta go.
Okay so, this is
what I was told here.
Pearl just texted me.
OMG, I am hanging out
with Logan French.
Should I be worried?
Only if you don't
wanna be a grandmother.
Logan French is one of the
hottest new teen pop stars
of the year, mhmm.
Well, that's reassuring.
Mmm, she's a smart girl.
And Cole is with her, right?
- Yeah.
- Well.
She is, but,
teen hormones and pop
stars have been known
to be a toxic combo.
I'm sure Cole's flexing his
muscles menacingly nearby.
So are you ready
for the baby shower?
I'm not
ready for anything.
This morning I cried
for five minutes
because my favorite
shoes wouldn't fit.
Bless your heart.
I don't
cry over shoes.
Well, everything's
gonna be perfect
for the shower on Saturday.
Jules lands in 37 hours.
God, I miss her.
I can't believe I have
a daughter in college
and a son on the way.
You're
having a boy, oh!
You didn't tell me!
I wasn't supposed to.
Oh.
I'm a mess.
Cole told me he was going to
do Sam's fundraiser auction,
and I swear, I hated
him for an hour.
Why would you hate him
for going to a charity auction?
Because it's a
bachelor auction
and they're short on
desirable bachelors.
You're worried that
some rich heifer's
gonna snatch him up
while you're shopping
for adult diapers, hmm?
No.
But my brain is melting.
Well, pull it together, Doc.
You have a root canal
on room two, eh?
Andale!
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Mhmm.
I'm fine.
âª There's so much
that doesn't show âª
âª So much we will never know âª
âª About each other âª
âª Unless we are brave enough âª
âª To face the undiscovered âª
Logan, that's brilliant.
Why aren't you recording that?
Instead of selling out?
Okay,
that's not what I'm-
- No, you're fine.
The thing people don't
understand is that
music and stuff's
still a part of me
that twists and turns,
but I know what I need to do
to build my fanbase
so they'll support me
when I do put out
the good stuff.
Yeah.
So you've come to recruit me
to the dark side.
No, I genuinely
wanna see you succeed.
I see a lot of potential in you.
But I know it's gonna
take a compromise.
You're not at all
what I expected.
I don't know
what that is, but,
No, in a good way, in a
good way, sorry.
We should probably get back
before your stepdad
keeps his promise
to rip me apart
with his bare hands.
Yeah.
It's getting late.
I need to be at the community
center in 20 to teach, so.
Community center?
Yeah, yeah,
I teach kids music.
It's a favor for
family, I love it.
You're not at all
what I expected either.
Thank you, yeah.
Hi, did you get my text?
What's wrong?
I have something I need
to talk with you about.
It's about,
Oh, for goodness
sakes, Stefani,
just go ahead and tell her.
It's about the music.
Oh, scheduling things?
I understand you're busy,
it's not that big of
a deal, we can work-
- It's not that.
I'm quitting, Pearl.
Oh.
I'm sure the kiddos
will miss you.
If she's your friend,
she'll support your decision.
It's not just the teaching.
What?
I'm quitting the band.
Music is just frivolous for me.
I don't need it like you do
and I'm graduating
early next December.
I really need to focus
on a serious future.
Stef, you do need
it and I need you.
She's not you.
She has her own goals.
Give us a moment, Bob.
It's Robert.
Anything you have to say to me
you can say in front of him.
Okay.
Okay yeah, yeah.
We are different, but,
do you remember the day we met?
I think so.
First day of third grade, right?
Yeah.
Yeah I was eight,
and I wore a Led
Zeppelin shirt to school
and you remember how it
just did not go over well?
Yeah.
So why don't
you like Justin Bieber?
He's just not a
quality musician.
His chord progressions
are derivative
and the use of
auto-tune is obsessive.
You're crazy.
He's perfect.
He has the voice
and hair of an angel.
That hair, it's a distraction.
He's just another
formulaic pretty boy
served up by the music industry.
You're so mean.
Nobody will be your friend.
Ladies, ladies.
Why are you picking
on the new girl?
She said Justin Bieber
was deriva-something.
She said his music was bad.
Well his choices are
pedantic and immature.
He's carefully packaged
and lacks nuance
and emotion and structure.
But Stefani, you're the
president of his fan club!
Well, I am going
to marry him someday.
I mean he's gorgeous and rich
but our prenup will say
I never have to listen
to his ridiculous music.
Thanks.
I'm Stefani.
I like your shirt.
I'm Pearl.
You should come to my house.
I just got the new
Sufjan Stevens album.
Okay.
We've been best
friends for eight years.
Pearl, we won't
stop being besties.
Okay.
Stef, that's not my point.
My point is that we
are very different
but the thing that's always
united us is our music.
I don't understand how
you can't see that, Stef.
I just, I don't
need it like you do.
But you do, Stefani.
You need the voice
music gives you.
Well she's outgrown
this little hobby.
Stay out of this, Bob.
He's right.
I'm done.
Excuse me, young lady.
In America we try to
respect our elders,
probably doesn't
even speak English,
sponging off our tax dollars.
See?
It means I am American,
and you actually ran into me.
Yeah, well, hey,
I would get your
paperwork in order
before you start mouthing off.
I'm here to see Adam Song.
Oh, he's my Uncle,
but he's in a class so you
can make an appointment.
Oh, an appointment, okay.
Well, could you please tell him-
Can I help you?
I'm Adam.
Thank you.
Sir.
Your niece was just about to
throw me out of the building.
I'm sorry.
Can I got a moment?
I believe he needs
an interpreter.
I think he's deaf.
Yes, I got the gist
of the exchange, Paul,
thank you very much.
This place is quite a
menagerie, isn't it?
Hello.
Would you
like to come into my office?
No.
No, that won't be necessary.
I'll be very brief.
The Kings have sold their
half of the building
to my brother and I,
and our plans unfortunately
do not include
a cute little get-together
space here, so,
we're going to have
to kindly ask you to
vacate the premises
in the next 30 days.
We have a
contract with your company
and the Kings for
another three years.
So even though you decided
to buy this building,
they wanna make sure
that we continue running
our place here.
And we pay the
first of the month.
You can't kick us out.
Yeah, excuse me.
You might wanna check clause
13F of your contract there.
It says if you're
delinquent in any way,
then the lease renewal is
subject to a provable solvency
for the following year.
We
have a monthly pledge,
we have annual grants.
And our money tends
to be variable
but we have never
been late on our rent.
Ooh, another mistake.
I think last December
they were late
and the December before that.
Okay, wait a minute.
The Kings covers one month
every year from their grants
and so their money getting
transferred to our account
takes a couple days.
Stop, look.
My hands are tied.
Your income is
inconsistent, hmm?
Grants, donations
and all of that,
they're not guaranteed.
But look, just look at
it from my point of view.
What if a tenant, a
reliable tenant comes to me
and says I want the place
for a year or more or 10,
who knows how many years?
And I don't give it to
them, I give it to you.
And the following month
you come to me and say
oh I'm sorry Mr. Neville,
but could you please,
could you just
give us a little extension?
That's not good business.
That just won't
work, correct Paul?
No.
So I'm gonna have
to ask you to place
your very favorable
30,000 dollars annual rent
into an escrow account
before the end of this term
which is 30 days.
30 days?
That's impossible.
Look, Mr. Sing, Song,
I'm not a monster, hmm.
How about I give
you another 10 days?
Call it a gift.
That takes you to,
well that takes you to the 24th.
Now there's a day you should
be able to remember, hmm?
You either pay up
or you get out.
Paul.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
And the prize for pin a
sperm on the egg goes to,
Greg Rodriguez!
Somebody knows their way around
with a blindfold.
And the winner of baby bottle
bowling goes to Christopher.
Oh, hey.
And some people know
their way around a nipple,
that's all I'm saying.
Hey.
I thought bowling was
more about powerful balls.
Oh
it's a family event,
boys, come on.
And the winner for the most
creative baby name goes to
Grandma Song for Vermouth
Compression Socks.
I though that
was the shopping list.
And the winner
of baby Song game
goes to our smarty pants
college girl Jules.
Yeah!
No.
Stay here.
Mom?
Yes?
You're gonna need
to let go, mom.
I need you to stay here.
I miss you so much.
Well.
And now Susan and
Cole are gonna open
their baby gifts, okay?
Oh yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
It is so itty bitty.
It's so cute.
Oh.
It is so cute.
Is mommy hurt?
No, Billie.
She's just very, very happy.
Then why is she crying?
Well, because she's
also very, very crazy.
Don't worry, kiddo.
It's not permanent.
At least I hope not.
Have you met my ex-wife?
Grandpa.
Are you trash talking Mormor?
Just making conversation.
I hear that.
Oh, grandpa.
I never met the guy.
Sure.
There's gotta be something.
You are so weak, Paul.
This is the sort of thing
that should have gone
through my lawyer.
I don't see
the problem, Aiden.
You found a clause that
can work in our favor.
That's right, I found it.
But that contract would have
been much more in our favor
if you had involved
me in the first place.
But you heard them.
There's no way they can come
up with that kind of money
in 40 days.
There are no new grants
this time of year.
Everyone is begging.
You do understand
that this is why
father left me in
complete control
of all company decisions.
But mother left
majority control
of the property to me, and,
I don't think she'd approve
of putting these kids out
on Christmas eve.
Yeah, because
she was soft like you.
Of course she knew that
you'd be helpless on your own
so she wanted to make
sure that her baby
had a safety net.
Don't insult mother.
She was a saint.
You'd better hope that
they do not figure this out.
This is a multi-million
dollar development deal
that depends on us
acquiring the entire block
that is 5,000 square feet
of prime retail space.
A lot more valuable than
these kids' little playground!
I'm telling you, if they do
raise the money, if they do,
you, big brother,
you are gonna have
to figure it out.
Not me!
You do realize,
that that clause gives
them an automatic renewal
for two years on the lease
if they raise the
money this year.
You put that together?
Look at me.
You're pathetic.
I just overheard something.
And you need to get that
contract looked over again.
We only need one year's rent.
Well that's something.
They're
all yours, Grandpa.
Thanks, Dylan.
Is everybody here?
Yeah, everybody is
present and accounted for.
Okay.
Uncle Adam's community center.
Now we all know how much good
Uncle Adam's done for
the last two years
with at-risk families.
Now they have until Christmas
to raise 30,000 dollars
or they are out on the streets.
Now I can make some calls but
we have got to get creative.
We're still getting a
little bit of ad revenue
from the talent show video.
You know, Grannies on the Go,
they're always looking
for new programs.
Maybe we could pair
up lonely seniors
with at-risk youth
and kill two birds
with one bullet.
I think you mean
stone, Grandma.
Well, that doesn't make sense.
I mean, how would you kill
two birds with one stone?
I mean, with a bullet
you just line them up
and it's a clean shot.
You know what, she's
got me there, yup.
You know, I love the idea.
Can you make some calls?
We can put up donation
cans at my office
and at the gym.
Yeah.
We can have a bake sale.
As long as you
don't eat the profits.
I can sell some of my toys.
That's
very sweet, Billie.
You know what, maybe we
could sell Theo's trumpet.
I'm getting better.
I'm joining Pearl's
band when I get big.
That's right.
You know, Theo, I
like the sound of that.
Oh, don't say
it, Judy Garland.
Why not?
We have so much talent here,
we could put together a
show and broadcast it live.
There is that
stage at the center.
I mean, the sound
system needs some work.
Frank?
And I can decorate it.
I could get my social
media class to help
with the marketing.
But we only have five weeks.
Whoah, whoah,
whoah, whoah, hold on.
What about school?
And how about songs
for a new label?
I've been pretty
stuck recently.
This could be the
inspiration I need.
I'm in.
You know what, me too.
I think we're all in.
We're crazy.
You guys, I hate to
break up this family moment
but I've gotta get
to the airport.
- Oh no.
- Why?
Safe travels.
- We'll miss you.
- Oh, Jules.
- Oh.
- Come here.
I need a group hug.
Group hug!
Okay I have to get
that flight now for real.
Hey Frank,
can I talk to you?
Yeah, what's up?
I have another idea.
A backup plan, but,
I'll need some help.
Does it involve
breaking any laws?
Ethical or judicial?
Possibly.
Then I'm in.
Hey, sweety.
How was band practice?
Oh.
It was all right.
We can live without a sax
and Haley and Car are picking
up the harmonies, but,
we are really
feeling her absence.
I always knew I needed her but
this feels very different.
But you know, we're
working out the kinks.
It'll be all right.
Yeah, I get it.
Are you okay?
I'm....
I'm just missing Jules.
The plane landed
an hour ago, but
I know there's 13 kids
running around, but,
it's like the shape of the
family changed when she left.
Yeah I miss her too, yeah.
I can go get Frank
and we can insult each
other for your amusement
if you'd like.
But you have this
little guy though.
Mmm, yeah.
Ah, my god.
You are not allowed
to leave me ever.
Ever.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
You're so silly.
You're so silly.
No, you're silly.
Silly meal so I got
schmutz on your shoulder.
Oh, there you are, darling.
I got off the phone, I
didn't know where you went.
I just thought I'd
help my poor baby
by bringing Aiden
your updated reports.
You two seem to
be getting along.
I'm making an
effort to get along
with my future brother for you.
All right, folks.
I believe that we are all
here so let's get to it.
Tessa's provided each of you
with a revised copy
of the blueprints
as well as an updated timeline
for the new city center.
If these projections
are accurate,
we should have a good
Christmas next year.
Quite right, Bitsy, I think
the Sloans are going
to be very pleased
with your decision.
I really like the
cabaret and cigar bar
on the ground floor of
the old King building.
Now there's months of renovation
left on that building.
How soon will it be vacant?
Well, there's a
small snag there, but,
Paul!
Nonsense.
They'll be out by Christmas.
Paul has been working on
these stage
renovations and decor.
I've already measured
and ordered the drapes.
Well Stevie and
I insist on sharing
the first bottle of Berlin
Croft from the new wine cellar.
Ooh, perhaps you can
save a taste or two for me
and Paul of course.
Of course.
Let's not pop our corks a
little too early here ladies.
We still have a lot
of work to do and
you and I have to get some
checks up to accounting
now that we have
begun phase two.
Yeah I've got Philip's funds.
He and Steve Stroe are
still in Dubai, so.
Great, there was an issue
with the wire transfer
but we're good.
All right, let's go.
Paul.
How is our little problem?
Well, it's pretty
quiet so far.
I haven't seen any grand plans.
I want you to
stay on top of it.
Try not to disappoint mother.
Oh, and you left
out one of the bids
in this package.
Don't worry, Aiden.
Listen, Tess, you
wanna grab some lunch?
I'm gonna be working
late tonight.
I'm gonna
head to the ladies room
but I'll be back in
a couple of minutes.
All right, just
meet me in my office
when you're done.
Hmm.
How can you let that dog
slobber all over you like that?
Well I never really
knew what a real man was
until I met you.
That's right.
Besides, you need
me to keep my eye
on a few things.
That I do.
Go on.
Oh.
Hey, hey.
You wanna pick up your
trash here, dearie?
Pretty soon, there
isn't gonna be room
for people like
you on this street
so just pick it up and
you might wanna
move out, all right?
Thank you, have a nice day.
Oh.
Well, well, there is
still some kindness here.
We did what anyone would do.
Yeah and I've got some
paper in my backpack
if you wanna cut up some more.
Oh, no, no here, here.
You take this.
Now if you tape
that in your window,
you're gonna get a snow day.
Miss,
you look familiar.
I mean I know I've seen
you out here before.
I just have one of
those kind of faces.
Um miss,
could we persuade you to
do a little favor for us?
Well, you are kind kids, but
I'm afraid I ain't got
nothing much to offer you.
Well, how would you like
a Thanksgiving makeover
to pull a little
prank on someone?
Oh, no, I don't
want any trouble.
Now what are you up to?
No good, but, it
involves a little trouble
for your friend
there in the suit.
Oh, I'm in.
All right, our next
bachelor up for auction is
Christopher, our
muscular gym manager.
Let's start the
bidding at 100 dollars,
what do you think, ladies?
100 dollars, can I start
the bidding at 100?
All right, let's start at 50,
let's start at 50 dollars.
50 dollars, I have 50 dollars.
So 50, get any more,
can I get more than 50?
Let's do 50 going
once, 50 going twice,
100 dollars from our
mystery bidder in the back,
100 going once, twice,
sold, thank you ma'am.
Thank you Christopher.
Nice job, ladies.
Our next bachelor is a
national MMA champion.
He's the owner of
Champion's gym.
You guys have seen him starring
in the Freeman
textiles commercials
and he's got a pretty
good Swedish accent.
Get your pals ready
ladies, for Cole Bennett!
All right, so here we go.
Let's start the
bidding at 100 dollars.
Can I get 100 dollars, 100.
Yes, I have 100.
100, looking for
two, can I get two,
yeah I get two.
Two and three, can I get three?
300 dollars, 300
looking for four.
300 dollars looking
for four, 400 dollars.
500 so fast, we're
doing great here, Cole.
500, looking for six.
Can I get six?
Six, now seven, 700 dollars?
Going once,
Say something in Swedish.
They want you to
say something in Swedish.
I've got 1000 dollars!
A thousand dollars?
That's a great bid,
a thousand dollars.
Can I get more than
a thousand dollars?
Is there anybody that'll
bid more than a thou?
1,500 dollars.
1500 dollars?
That would be a new record.
1500 going once.
1500 going twice.
And for a new record
for the charity,
sold for 1500 dollars!
Nice job.
He's asleep.
Ready for it?
I think so.
Gloria, this camera's
running through a program
to make you look like a hologram
so don't move too much.
And there's a hidden mic
so you can hear
him in your earbud.
And there's
a speaker in your wig
so he can hear you
through that little mic.
Okay.
You know
the script, right?
You ready?
I don't know, boys.
I don't think he'll buy it.
Then we're no
worse off than before.
And remember,
you have to make sure
he's distracted or
his eyes are closed
before we shut you off
or else he might
notice the projector.
Okay, okay.
Paul?
Paul Montgomery Neville.
Paul!
Is someone?
Don't you recognize me?
Am I dreaming?
I appear to those in need
in the form of those
they love most.
Mother?
I am the ghost
of holidays past.
Isn't that Christmas past?
We say holidays now.
Oh.
What do you want with me?
I am disappointed,
my Monty bear.
Monty bear?
It is you!
Why are you sad, mommy?
Why are you trying to
shut down the center?
We have to make profits.
Aiden has a huge deal
and we need the whole block.
I'm trying to make
good decisions.
Good decisions
and most profits
are not always compatible.
Daddy always made
tough decisions.
Aiden always said that-
- Let me tell you
a story from 1961.
Are you gonna fly me back
to our house on Cornell?
Always the
flair for the dramatic.
No, there are special
effects everywhere now.
We prefer to keep
it simple, hmm.
Where was I?
Oh yes, back at
the little house.
We were so poor then,
why we only had one maid
who just came in weekly.
Mildred.
Now every Thanksgiving,
your father would bring
Mildred a huge turkey
and bags of groceries.
And when you were
six, he let you
give Mildred her gift.
I forgot the
bag with the pies.
Hmm, he made you ride downtown
to take them to that
patched up little house?
I'd never seen
a place like that.
Mildred was serving food
to a dozen people in rags.
She could have eaten for a week
but she gave most every
bit to the others.
And what did you
father tell you?
That she was a fool.
You have to take care of
yourself and your family.
Father confessed he was
trying to toughen you up
but that soon he would teach you
how important people
like Mildred were.
You see, in that room perhaps
there was a hungry child
who would find the
cure for cancer
if only someone gave him hope.
After that, he
brought Mildred food
for every holiday.
Really?
But father always said
that you have to take
care of yourself.
I guess he didn't
live long enough
to teach you and Aiden the
most important lessons.
Oh, he built strong spines
but he never got a
chance to show you
how the heart is most important.
Wish I would have known
this side of father.
And now I need
to go, my darling.
But I still have
so many questions.
Tell me.
Oooh, I hear the
angels calling me.
Now just lean back and close
your eyes for a moment.
What the heck
is happening in here?
Just a little project.
Are you projecting
this somewhere?
It's to
Paul Neville's office.
Well I just saw his
evil brother come in
through the lobby, so.
Shoot.
We gotta keep him away
from Paul's office
or we're gonna be
in big trouble.
I'm getting the
heck out of here.
Mr. Neville, hi, I am
so glad I caught you.
What are you doing in here?
I just wanted to apologize
for being so rude
to you last week.
Fine, then get
out of my building.
I realize you're
a very important man
and I was wondering if
maybe you could give me
some advice for an
aspiring musician?
Yeah sure, stay in
school, stay off drugs,
get yourself a real job.
Okay, I was thinking
maybe more you could like
listen to my music and
give me your opinion.
I really don't
have time for this.
What is wrong with you?
What are you doing?
I love doing that!
I mean I used to
when I was a kid.
Didn't you?
âª Elevator fun's like
a Christmas tree âª
âª Brings back childhood to me âª
âª Elevator puns
parading around âª
âª You gotta love
that dinging sound âª
âª Pooom like Christmas bells âª
âª I can make a song
about anything âª
You know, we do have
security in this building, hmm?
Out of my way.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Mommy?
Paul, what, what?
Aiden, Aiden!
Mommy was just here!
She sang to me.
We talked about Dad.
And she even talked about
the old house on Cornell.
Interesting.
So now you're talking
to dead people.
Hey mom, hey dad.
I'm right with you, brother.
Carry on.
Yeah?
Ah, hi Sam.
Hey, Sam.
Hey, Sam, what's up, man?
It's been a long time.
I'm just getting ready
for a show in New York.
In the Caymans getting
ready for a shoot.
They're doing
great work here.
The show's on December 22nd.
Oh dude, that's rad.
I just wanna know.
Can I count on you for an
appearance or a donation
to support these great kids?
Well that sounds great, yeah,
I'd love to take part.
Thanks, Mitch.
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
Sure, I can help.
Oh, the Swish would love to
make an appearance, man, but,
the Swish and the minions
are about to hit the road
for a tour, I'm sorry.
Okay, thanks anyway.
Wait, I got an idea.
How about a signed
guitar by the Swish?
That'll work, that'll
make you some money.
Super!
Man, you always come through.
Thank you very much.
All right, rad, man.
I'll talk to you soon.
Ciao.
Hey, son.
Hey dad.
I need a favor.
Can you keep an
eye on the house?
The little ones
are already asleep.
Sure, yeah, I gotta make
some calls to the west coast
since it's after nine,
just leave the door open.
Where you heading?
Promised Svenska
I was gonna help her
with something at
the house, so yeah.
Svenska?
Yeah, you know,
the benefactor.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Well, we hit it off,
we had a great time
and I told her I'd
pop by this week.
All right.
Thanks, you're the man.
Cole?
Cole.
Do you have the file with the
kids' social security numbers?
Yeah, I'm hopping
in the shower though.
But hey, I emptied my pockets
in the kitchen somewhere.
It should be on my phone.
I don't know my own password.
How do you expect me to?
Obviously I don't know yours.
Okay, any little ears around?
No.
Okay, all caps.
HDA14+1.
HDA14?
Got it.
What's wrong, dear?
Cole is apparently
having an affair with
someone named Svenska.
Well, dear.
You can't keep them
locked in your embrace
their whole lives, you know.
Mom, what?
Well, men need the
freedom to explore
what is out there in the world
and he's not a child anymore.
I say, cest la vie.
Wow, cool, thanks, Mom.
Hey, Grandma.
Duncan.
Saul, Cole.
No, I'm Dylan, Grandma.
Of course.
Well if you see
your brother Cole,
tell him that your
mother is very concerned
that he's dating.
Oh, this tooth.
Definitely need Valium.
I don't think you're allowed
to have Valium, Grandma.
Oh, crap, that's right.
I never asked, okay, Duncan?
Dylan.
Okay, Grandma.
Hey Grandma?
Duncan!
Saul, Cole, Cole.
No, Cole is my,
never mind.
Duncan is dating
Cole.
Thank you for coming.
Lauren and I met backstage
at the talent show thing last
year and we connected online.
I remember you.
You were awesome and beautiful.
Aw, thank you.
I'm so excited by what
you guys are trying to do.
It's a great cause.
Yeah.
And she's also a
dope choreographer,
so I was thinking she
could have some cool input
on our finale.
But as far as your
solo piece, you're in.
Wonderful.
As for a group finale,
I have a few ideas
and wanna know more.
Thank you.
Weren't you the stage
manager at the state show?
You perform?
Yeah, I'm actually
a singer and a dancer.
Great.
I volunteered to
stage manage last year
when I missed the
deadline to compete.
Well, we're really excited
to see what you can do.
âª Silent night âª
âª Holy night âª
âª All is calm âª
You do realize
you'll have to be
on a stage with an audience?
Is it a requirement
to face the audience?
I got this, I'm just
a little nervous, sorry.
Well let's think about that.
Thank you, Mr. Kavanaugh.
Well thank you.
So sorry guys,
I feel like I got this.
Here we go.
Hey neighbors.
Oh, Winnifred Hawkins-White,
I didn't expect to see you here.
I've actually been
writing and playing music
with my cousin for years.
I had no idea.
This just didn't seem
like my kind of thing.
Look, whatever my mom says,
you guys were actually
really kind neighbors.
A little loud
sometimes, but nice.
I love your dress.
Thank you.
I saw your fundraiser posted
and I really admire
what you're doing.
I'm glad you share a
passion for the community.
To be honest, I'm driven
way more by the fact
that this is really, really
gonna piss off my mom.
Bonus.
Let's see what you got.
Why is Aiden
having you assemble these?
I mean shouldn't an
assistant be doing this?
Information's too proprietary.
We can't risk having
anyone else's eyes on this.
Now when I'm done
with this last number
they will get printed
and locked up.
Thanks for helping.
Of course, darling.
Hey, hey, hey.
Did you replace the
pages, fix all the totals?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
You are a rock star.
I can't believe
this time next month
all this will be mine.
You mean ours, Aiden.
Yes, yes, of course yes, ours.
Paul Montgomery
Neville, wake up!
Huh?
Who are you?
Really?
I'm the ghost of
holidays present.
Shouldn't you look
kinda like Santa?
Fool, where have you been?
Haven't your mama
explained last week?
Hello, holidays.
I'm the Kwanza Queen.
Who are they?
Look closer.
Ugh, peasants.
I hate poor people.
And puppies, I kick puppies!
Please sir, can't we
have just a crust of bread?
Does that crutch work?
It's a good prop
for the suckers.
I want all the
moneys.
Why is he so mean?
You know Billie,
because he is a monster.
I don't know, maybe
his shoes are too tight.
Oh, I see.
My brother.
Got
any puppies I can kick?
No, he's not that bad.
He's a bit greedy and critical
but he works hard to
make the Neville name.
Oh, Aiden darling, you're
so smart and powerful.
Here's a puppy for you to kick.
Oh no, poor puppy.
Let's kick all the puppies
and children off the street.
And your weak brother too.
Let's take all the money.
No.
No, that's not my Tessa.
I mean Aiden is a bit cold, but,
Tessa's an angel.
Dude, are you sure?
We brought a visual
aid this time.
Are you sure?
Yeah, he deserves to know.
Besides, they're his
security cameras anyway.
This way he finds out
before it's too late.
Ah, Tessa dear, with your help
we are gonna fix my
mother's little problem
and flip controlling
interest of Neville
to where my father
always intended it.
You're right.
So pathetic.
A few more years of him
controlling this company and
we would be reduced
to strip malls.
Well, he sure doesn't have
your vision and fortitude.
You know, you are 10
times the man Paul Neville
will ever be.
So, how was your Thanksgiving?
It was fine.
Mine was delicious.
Wait, fine?
What do you mean fine?
Cole is having an
affair with some heifer
- from the bachelor auction.
- No.
No way, not Cole.
You know I would
know if he were-
- Why would you know?
Well, don't be mad.
I didn't tell you yet
but I've been
dating Christopher.
Oh.
Girl, he is fine.
A few fixable qualities, but,
but a good man.
Oh I'm sorry girl.
You know, I'm
sorry for going on.
Are you okay?
Does it look like I'm okay?
I can't believe this.
Mm-mmm, not Cole.
And Chris is his best friend.
Oh you should hear the
way he talks about you.
I took a picture of
his texts with Svenska.
Oh, girl.
Her name, her name even,
even sounds like, Svenska.
You know, I'm too
much of a lady to say.
Do you think I should
follow him after work?
In what disguise, huh?
Maybe as Santa Claus right now?
Oh, wait, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry girl, listen.
That wasn't very,
Just...
Bless your heart.
Bless your heart.
Listen, I'm gonna talk to Chris,
see what I can find out, okay?
Mira, I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.
Okay?
Just go ahead and sign in, okay?
Forgot my purse.
- Okay?
- It's fine.
Put Theo
on stage a lot.
Because last time, the
audience freaking loved Theo.
He's refined like a star.
No, I don't know.
I know he said this
as kind of a joke
but what if we just
let Theo do his thing?
With no
choreography, but like-
Can we help you?
Hmm?
Ah, yes.
I'm not sure what
you're working on here
but I wouldn't bet on
it getting very far.
Oh, we were just
gonna do a small show
to raise some rent money,
but you're probably right.
What can some little kids do
against a big businessman?
Hmmm.
Don't you be
patronizing with me.
My connections run very deep.
In fact I wouldn't be surprised
if you're paid a visit from
the government very soon.
You see, the problem is
with people like you,
you and your families,
you start running
out of places to hide
wherever you're from,
so what do you do, you come
into this country, my country,
you come in, more often
than not, illegally
and you start looking
for handouts, freebies.
Well I can tell you this.
They're not coming out
of this pocket, mmm-mmm.
You will be out of this
building by Christmas.
Statistically
speaking, immigrants
are half as likely to commit
a crime as regular citizens.
So you can live in your
little privileged bubble,
but the world doesn't
belong to you.
Yeah, yeah, bravo.
Bravo, bravo.
You are well trained
little puppets, aren't you?
Good luck with your little play
and you know what, I might
even get myself a ticket.
Could prove to be
very interesting.
Thank you.
But you should hurry up because
they're almost sold out.
It's empty.
Toss it for me, sweety.
You know how to
clean a house, right?
Wait.
Are we actually almost sold out?
No.
No, no, no.
But we might be.
You're actually
calling Logan French right now?
Wait, she knows Logan French?
Where have I been?
Where do
you usually go, Car?
Hey.
Hi, hi Logan.
I was just calling to see
if you were gonna come down
to Michigan to see your Grandma.
Oh, I think we are.
How's it going finding
the perfect hit song?
Don't ask.
I've been a little distracted.
Do you know when
you might be in?
Well my tour doesn't
end for another 10 days.
I don't have to be back in
New York until the 30th.
Is there a reason for
me to come back sooner?
We could write some
tunes together?
Yeah, I'd like that.
But look, I have a
huge favor to ask.
And I promise, I'll
write all weekend.
A favor?
Okay, shoot.
Hey J-Pug, can you
help me with song ideas?
Okay.
How about a song
about net neutrality?
Everybody's got an
opinion about it
but nobody's written
a hit song about it.
Okay.
Writing down net neutrality.
Not sure how to
make that personal.
Really?
Dire Straits wrote a song
about a bunch of factory
workers complaining,
and it became a hit song.
Hey, guess what?
- What's up, little beastie?
- What?
I wanna sing at school.
We all wrote a list to Santa
and mine got picked to
read at the whole school
at our party next week.
Wow.
That's pretty cool, buddy.
Only, I'm
kind of nervous.
Well, would you like to
practice in front of us?
Okay.
Dear Santa, I hope you are
having a good Christmas
or Hanukkah if you're Jewish,
or Kwanzaa if you're African.
Or whatever that T thing
is about if you're Chinese.
My birth mom is Muslim
so I get to hug everyone three
times and give them a date.
Not like the kissing
kind of date, yuck.
This kind is a fruit.
Maybe I will leave you
one instead of cookies.
I'm from a place called Syria
but you probably knew that.
I hope you go there a
lot on Christmas Eve
because there are lots of sad
children there with no toys.
Plus I don't want any
toys for Christmas
or Eid, or whatever.
I just want other kids to
get mommies, that's all.
Can you please bring
all the kids in Syria
and wherever they don't
have the mommies and daddies
because they are the best thing.
No offense to the elves
but mommies are better
than any other crap,
sorry, they make.
I got Kwanzaa, Eid,
Christmas, Hanukkah, T-time.
Your friend, Theo.
#alliwantforchristmasismoremomms
Oh Theo, that's
just beautiful.
Thanks, Grandma.
Only, is there a Santa?
'Cause Andrea said there wasn't.
Or why didn't those kids
in Syria already get toys?
Well, Theo.
Someone very wise once told me
that just because
something isn't real
doesn't mean it's not true.
As long as you believe.
Thanks, Pearl.
I'm gonna go read to mommy.
I hope she doesn't crazy cry.
You want some help moving
that keyboard upstairs?
Yeah, sure.
I think I'm ready to
go write that song.
Pearl.
Hi.
Did you get it?
Yeah, I did.
Hi, Pearl.
I hope you are well.
Hi, Robert.
I just came by to talk
to Stef for a sec.
Well she certainly
doesn't need my permission
to talk with an old friend.
How progressive of you.
Guys.
I really did like it, Pearl.
Thank you.
But you're my sounding board
and I am not quite
finished with it yet.
I need a Stef breakdown.
Well that, that
was a nice catchup,
but she's not in the
music game anymore.
Robert, it's
just a conversation.
What, you get sucked
into things like this
because they're fun, easy,
intellectual bubble gum
and then you lose focus.
It's not bubble gum.
Stefani, I'm
trying to help you.
I mean, you're a beautiful girl.
But if you persist
in wasting your time
on frivolous pursuits,
you'll never develop
any functional skills.
So you're just saying
I have nothing else
to offer the world
besides being pretty?
Sweetheart, you know nothing
about politics or history.
Technology, business, sports.
I mean you're not unintelligent.
You have tremendous potential.
But you insist on filling
your pretty little head
with things that don't matter.
And then, there's
no more room left
for the things that do.
To you.
What?
Things that don't
matter to you.
Stef is an encyclopedia of
pop culture, art, fashion.
Things that inspire people
and make them feel things.
That is so incredibly important.
And if you cared about her
half as much as you
care about yourself,
you would see how
freaking brilliant she is.
Pearl.
I'm sorry.
I just have one
problem with the song.
What?
I don't see any place for
a killer saxophone solo.
Bob?
This is ridiculous,
you kidding me?
Listen, here's what
I'm gonna tell you.
You are not Gucci
material, okay?
Bye.
And also one more thing,
No, freaking Bob.
I've missed you.
I'm finally giving up on men.
We're gonna go all golden girls
and live together as old maids.
No, seriously, a boy, who?
Maybe.
And maybe Logan French.
Shut up, seriously?
To heck with the song.
You're gonna need
professional advice
and maybe a tweezer, come on.
Thank you all
for coming so soon.
Please, pass them down.
Is everything okay, Aiden?
Uh, yes, no, well,
we had a problem
and then a solution
albeit a difficult
one for me personally.
The first document there
is the initial report
that we handed out to investors.
It includes expenses to date
as well as all the accepted bids
for phase two of the
St. Matthews project.
Now the second document, the
one that you've just received,
I just discovered in
a second set of books
being kept by my brother.
You'll notice that in
the initial report,
all the figures, the
expenses, the bids
are all much higher than
in the second report
which indicates to me that
my misguided brother,
has been cooking the books.
Why, I don't know.
I suppose to tap into the
margins that he created,
I don't know.
But my fastidious oversight
caught this in time.
And I do not think that this
is an insurmountable problem.
I don't understand, Aiden.
These numbers seem
to be identical
and include notarized copies
of the bids and receipts.
Please hold.
Yes, it appears that Tessa
has copied the same report.
No, the numbers match
but the reports have
different dates and fonts
and only one has
the backup data.
What's going on, Aiden?
Should we be concerned?
No, no, no no.
I've just been handed
incorrect information
but rest assured, I will
get to the bottom of this.
In the meantime, know
that all accounts
have been locked.
Nobody can touch
them, money is safe.
You don't need to be concerned.
Hi.
Mrs. Green, I'm Selena.
And I'm Babbette, but
my friends call me Babe.
So excited to get started.
This is our first.
Both, not together.
We both have baby daddies.
AKA husbands.
I'm sorry, I'm
not the instructor.
This is kind of my first too.
Oh, I thought,
I mean we just assumed
you were the instructor.
I'm just as new to all this.
Oh, but you're,
Oh wow, you go,
girl, look at you,
I mean, my mom is
49 and she's like
I am too old to be
changing any diapers.
Great.
I'm gonna go find my husband.
Cool.
So awkward.
Hi everyone, sorry I'm
running a little bit late.
So we're just gonna
get right to it.
Actually it looks
like some of us
are still missing our partners
so let's just wait
another minute.
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.
How are you?
I'm good, how are you?
Oh come here.
This is Selena and this is,
Babe, yeah, I know, we met.
Class is starting.
All right.
Hey, tell Ted and
Gary to stop by
the new gym, okay?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett.
See you next week.
Oh, hey, Susan.
Are you in a hurry or
you got a little time?
Yeah.
Yeah, Mom has the littles,
your dad is with her
too, so yeah, why?
If you're not
too super exhausted
I wanna take you
to meet someone.
We're gonna leave your car here,
it'll be 10, 15 minutes.
Okay.
- Come on.
- Fine.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
So this is my friend
Svenska's house.
âª Please don't be
wasting my time âª
âª With that business âª
âª Who you kidding man âª
âª Yeah yeah yeah yeah âª
âª Wow yeah swear to
god I'm with it âª
âª I don't see
nobody in my lane âª
Ah Cole,
I make you some
Hi, Mormor.
Lana, my sweet granddaughter.
I hoped you would meet.
And this must be
your beautiful bride.
You have such a sweet husband.
You're lucky to have
a sweet husband.
You're Svenska?
Yes.
And you are the beautiful
and brilliant Susan.
You must be Lana.
And you're responsible
for our new friendship.
Yes.
I heard you speak
Swedish at the auction.
Mormor always goes
on about how much
she misses her husband, and,
how much she misses
her language.
Dolph and I came here
when we were just married.
The children resisted
learning Swedish.
I went to this event
to help orphans
and I left with a dear friend
who I can speak with.
Mormor told me what you did
and got that horrible
raccoon out of her attic.
He was all scratched up.
But I make it up to you.
I baked his favorite
Swedish dish,
Pastry?
Mhmm.
Raccoon.
Claw marks.
Best ever.
- Best ever.
- Oh, no no.
You know what?
You are wonderful
and I love you.
Oh.
Baby you are
completely bonkers.
I love you and I love you.
I love all of you.
I love you guys so much.
I love you too, honey.
She's completely bonkers.
Oh my god!
You scared me.
Oh, but I guess that's
the point, right?
Ghost of holidays future?
What are these?
Your past,
present and future.
I don't understand.
This is my father's
old accounting journal,
some photo albums and,
what's on the flash drive?
These old buildings
are filled with surprises
including a 25 year old
hidden security system.
Who are you?
Once the tapes are full,
they're taped over
until replaced.
Surprisingly they still work
with four hidden cameras.
The flash is a highlight reel
that might help you
with your future.
Okay, okay.
What about the rest?
We thought they
might help you.
Paul, Paul, Paul!
Come on man, I heard you
screaming from down the hall.
Did you fall asleep again?
Have another nightmare?
What is that?
Security!
Security, get in here!
Wait, wait, wait, where'd it go?
Where did what go?
Wait, is that safe?
The thing, the thing, the thing,
it was just right there.
This demon, you saw
it, it was floating.
No I think you've been working
too hard, little brother.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the St. Matthews
Holiday Extravaganza Fundraiser!
Tonight is a night
of holiday joy,
music, dancing,
magic and comedy.
But mostly it's a night
to help the children.
I hope you are all inspired
by the spirit of the holidays
and our show, to open up
your hearts and your wallets.
And now, without
any further ado,
I'm excited to
introduce our host
and my childhood
hero, Dr. Bunsen.
Mr. Sam Bennett!
Thank you.
There you go, high
five, thanks kids.
Happy holidays, everyone.
And thank you for taking a break
from your holiday
festivities of shopping,
baking, and parties
to join us for this great cause.
So without further ado,
I give you the Stony
Creek Chamber Choir!
Well, is he here yet?
No.
Did you call him?
Yeah, but, he's not
responding to anything.
He'll be here.
Next up, 13 year old
Winnifred Hawkins-White
will perform an original
song titled Free.
âª I got independence
running through my veins âª
âª Gonna take this life of mine âª
âª And grab it by the reins âª
âª Oooh âª
âª I make mistakes
every day of my life âª
âª I make mistakes way
too many to count âª
âª But every mistake
that I made in my life âª
âª It made me better
'cause I made it count âª
âª Not taking Ls but
I'm taking lessons âª
âª Gaining knowledge,
coming back for seconds âª
âª A part of wisdom, now
I'm saying the seconds âª
âª You know I'm saving time
because I got the message âª
âª I work from cartwheels
to doing backflips âª
âª But on the way there
there was some crack âª
You guys.
Did you just see Miles
and Dad's dance moves?
Oh my god.
No way.
âª Then you see my path
and they conversating âª
âª But when I level up
in the conversation âª
âª In the conversation âª
Oh my god, Pearl,
I'm so sorry.
My Grandma fell with this thing
and it had sauce and then
she fell in the sauce.
And then we thought
she broke her hip
and then when I tried to
go help her with the sauce
my phone fell.
Grandma's fine.
Oh, okay.
My phone isn't.
Oh, well, I'm
sorry to hear that
but look, you're
on like right now.
Do you need water, tea?
No, I'm good, I have my own.
And don't apologize,
it's for a good cause.
Yeah.
So what are you performing?
Probably gonna start out
with some sellout music
to get the crowd hyped.
Oh.
I'm so sorry about that.
I didn't mean to say that
you're a sellout artist.
It's just, you're
so talented and
all they see is this
attractive piece of clay
that they can mold into money.
So you think I'm attractive?
I think the universe,
and it's like a known thing
that you're attractive
in the universe.
So you don't think
that I'm attractive?
Well I never said that
I disagree with them.
Like I see what they see in you.
So does the fact that
I think you're funny,
amazing and very, very,
very, very attractive
make you feel any sort of way?
I'm saying that,
wait, you do?
I don't...
We are so blessed to have
a very special guest here
to support our great cause.
He signed a record deal in
high school just recently
for Abstruse Records
and his hit song Love Club
has recently been surpassed
by his new hit song.
I'm sorry if I was
reading into this
and made this awkward.
Oh, no it's okay.
I'm always kind of a
moderate level of awkward, so.
Okay, well I should
probably get up there.
Yeah your fans.
Yeah.
Logan.
Go be true.
What, what?
Ladies and gentlemen,
please make him feel
welcome, Logan French!
Hey Detroit!
How you guys doing?
I'm going to be bringing
out the band in a little bit
to sing a few songs that
you guys already know.
But I wanted to start off
tonight with something new.
Hope you like it.
âª When the music
is fading away âª
âª And you can't find
the right words to say âª
âª You don't know
where to start âª
âª Look for the song
inside your heart âª
âª And be strong, never give up âª
âª Hold on, you are the one âª
âª I could take you higher âª
âª Let me feel your fire âª
âª Look into my eyes,
you can't deny it baby âª
âª You ought to meet
me at the love club âª
âª Yeah âª
âª See you ought to meet
me at the love club âª
âª Peace between
and surge of love âª
âª People singing from the loft âª
âª Peace on earth
and happy hearts âª
âª Don't stop believing
just because âª
âª Just because they
say it's not real âª
âª Doesn't mean it's not true âª
âª You gotta show him
all the love you feel âª
âª So they can feel it too âª
âª Give them a reason to
believe in a season of love âª
âª It's a season of
love, love, love âª
âª A season of love âª
âª I believe in
love, love, love âª
âª A season of love âª
âª My Muslim friends
celebrate the end of sorrow âª
âª On the holiday of Eid âª
âª They get dressed up âª
âª Dance and sing âª
âª That sure sounds fun to me âª
âª My Jewish cousin
brought me to a party âª
âª For the festival of lights âª
âª People let me tell you âª
âª I have never had a better
time in all my life âª
âª So many ways we holiday âª
âª But it all comes back
to just one thing âª
âª That's love, love, love âª
âª A season of love âª
âª I believe in
love, love, love âª
âª A season of love âª
âª So tell your father, your
mother, and your sister too âª
âª Your uncle, your brother,
and your best friend's boo âª
âª Gather all the neighbors âª
âª Tell them what
we're gonna do âª
âª We're gonna celebrate the
holidays with you sugar âª
âª Love, love, love âª
âª The season of love âª
âª I believe in
love, love, love âª

âª Love, love, love âª
âª The season of love âª
âª I believe in
love, love, love âª
âª The season of love âª
Well.
That was a modeling
display, huh.
Let's just pray that the masses
don't pony up enough funds.
I think you would
have rather enjoyed it
if you had taken the
stick out of your ass.
I'm sorry, what did you say?
Let's not forget who the brains
of this operation is, brother.
You might wanna
take an extra look
at father and mother's papers.
Although I expect
you already know
that my 51 percent gives
me a few more options
than you'd care for.
Paul, what has
gotten into you?
It might have something
to do with the fact
that my devoted fiancee,
the lovely Tessa Anderson is
having an affair
with my brother.
What are you going-
- Who is committing
fraud to help wrest
control of the company
while putting these poor
kids out on the street.
Paul.
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?
I am glad that
there's a witness here
to finally see that my
brother has gone insane.
Delusions of ghosts and demons,
speaking to our dead mother.
Really, Aiden?
Wasn't it you who saw
the kabuki grim reaper?
Do you not cross the line!
You don't scare me.
You do not cross the line.
Heavens, Martha.
You know, we were about
to give up on you.
Susan finished her patients.
Now she's leaving her
notes for Dr. Schlesinger
for her maternity leave.
Perhaps she hasn't noticed
that the arctic has descended.
Sam drove two hours
through the tundra
just to get me here.
If I don't have tooth pain,
I'll be buried in the
snow bank on the way home.
Someone is
uncharacteristically surly.
Maybe you've
encountered people
with severe tooth pain in
your line of work before?
Oh, mom.
I just looked outside.
I had no idea it
had gotten that bad.
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.
Oh.
Well, let's get that cracked
tooth out right away.
Time to gas up Grandma Grumpy.
I can't feel a
thing, Miss Susan.
Oh.
I just want a normal squid.
Is that too much to ask?
The giant ones
are just too much,
it's so hard to find a
leash big enough for them.
I hear ya.
You gotta stick with the
small squids, you know.
Okay.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Okay, we're gonna
need an elevator.
Where are we going?
An elevator's a dental tool.
I'm gonna start loosening
that cracked tooth.
Oh, be careful Susan.
I am venomous.
My spit can kill you.
Okay, I'll be careful.
So Mom.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Oh no.
Do you need assist?
No, I think my
water just broke.
No, no, no, no, excuse me.
You're not due for
another four weeks, so no.
- No, no, no.
- I'm pretty sure.
Oh my god.
Bless your heart.
Well, can you finish?
My back has been hurting
and I had to pee like
every five minutes, but,
oh!
Oh!
No, no, no, no.
I don't wanna die,
I'm calling 911, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm pretty sure
that's a contraction.
Oh my god.
I can help you with the rats.
Yes, hello?
I have a woman in labor.
She's 37 weeks.
Now first thing we need is
to keep mom calm and hydrated.
Sugar, I need you to keep an eye
on her contractions
and dilation.
Now when we get to
be about the width
of a cocktail shaker,
that's when we're going to
need to get ready to push.
Until then, just
breathe slow and steady.
I'm gonna need a
cocktail after this.
A few of them in therapy.
Does my medical cover therapy,
does it cover that?
Let me go and check your
benefits package right now.
- Oh!
- Oh, oh!
Oh!
Oh my god, this hotel!
I have good news.
We have a unit on the way.
Oh, praise Jesus.
Oh.
Is this thing on?
I can't tell.
Can you check this for me?
Do you see hippos?
- No.
- Well then it's on.
Oh, thanks.
Halfway done.
All right.
Merry Christmas.
All right.
Ugh.
Brr, okay, all right,
all right, here we go.
Brrr.
No I just,
I gotta go check on
Susan's vajayjays
to see if it's getting
to be cocktail time.
Oh, back here, back here!
How far in are we?
About seven
centimeters dilated
and her contractions
are seven minutes apart.
Oh thanks, the
exterminators are here,
they won't let me bring my cat.
Do you validate?
I brought my camel in but
the camel parking here
is just so expensive
on this planet.
Is she okay?
Oh, she's as fine as the
dew on a butterfly's whiskers,
okay, bless her heart.
Come on, Susan, okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Martha.
Good.
You're doing great.
You're doing great.
Okay, okay, all
right, it's okay.
Just till the next contraction.
A little bit, okay.
Deep breathing,
nice deep breath.
Nice deep breath.
Good job.
Good job, Susan.
Oh, you got here just in time.
What?
Are you making a crack
about my age now?
No, no, no, no, no.
You're about two
pushes away, good job,
excellent, excellent, excellent.
Susan, good job, good job.
Good job, Susan.
Breathe, breathe,
honey, breathe, breathe.
Oh my god baby, I got
here as soon as I could,
I'm so sorry.
He's here.
Hey.
Hey baby.
Oh baby,
- help me.
- It's okay.
All right, all right.
Here he comes, here he comes.
Beautiful!
Excellent, Susan.
You'd think he was
the baby Jesus himself.
You drew a crowd.
Yeah.
Now that crowd up there,
that's this little guy's family.
Oh my.
Oh.
You know it's just
like the first Noel.
A gathering from the
four corners of the earth
to welcome a great miracle.
He's greeting his family, ooh.
I see that.
Mr. Song.
It's 10 p.m.
Unless you're ready
to wire 30,000 dollars
by five p.m. tomorrow,
I think you look like
you're a little behind
on your packing.
I think that you'll
find everything in order
when the bank opens tomorrow.
But that's impossible.
According to the statement
that you issued to the press
not more than an hour ago
you were still, what was it,
about 5,000 dollars behind today
despite all your
valiant efforts.
Kings just released
their annual grant funding
of 2500 dollars
and I just got an
11th hour benefactor
to fulfill the difference,
and I was able to deposit
it before the bank closed.
Mr. Song.
This is not over.
Not by a long shot.
I have lawyers who are
willing to work on Christmas.
I have building contractors
who belong to my country club.
I suggest, Aiden,
that you start packing.
I have security
waiting to escort you
out of your office.
Paul.
Let me guess.
The soft-hearted, soft-headed
11th hour benefactor.
Brother, are you telling
me you're willing
to give up millions of dollars
so the poor and the broken
can just muddy up streets
that we have ready
to pave with gold?
And don't you forget, I
have the board on my side
and they are well aware of all
your little eccentricities.
You'll find a flash
drive on your desk
that contains security footage
from hidden cameras
throughout these buildings.
An identical drive was
delivered this evening
to every board member.
There's enough evidence on there
to send you to prison
for a long time.
Oh come on, big brother, what,
you're gonna send
me to prison now?
Oh, I'm not a monster, Aiden.
You'll also find a
contract on your desk
giving 100 percent control
of Neville Brothers to me,
with you receiving a
very generous allowance
of 10 percent of all profits.
Just for staying away
and not interfering
with our operations
or the operations of the
Emilia Langford Neville
Memorial Community Center.
Bravo.
Looks like my big brother
finally grew a backbone.
Only I'm gonna call his bluff.
Do you really
expect me to believe
that you installed
security cameras
throughout two of our buildings
without me knowing it?
I didn't do that.
Well then who did?
That was mother.
Huh?
Paul.
Paul, darling.
Listen.
I was only doing this
so I could protect you.
I'm really only just trying-
- Save it, darling.
I have a sleigh to catch.
Paul.
Paul, Paul, wait please.
One more.
Perfect.
We were just talking about
how we have too many
big ones on this side.
So we either need to
like move these ones.
- Did the kids decorate this?
- A household.
We have too many big ones
- on this side.
- Wait, do you see this?
Thanks for
letting me join you.
I was going to Chicago
with Robert's family and
I couldn't get a
ticket until tomorrow
to my Grandma's.
What's one more?
And another.
Ho, ho, ho.
Oh, come on in, holy.
Sorry.
Ah thanks.
Look who I
found wandering outside.
I seem to find
myself without a family
to celebrate the
holidays with and
I come bearing a catered
gourmet holiday feast.
We heard what you
did for the center.
You're more than welcome here.
Oh, thank you.
Happy holidays, everyone.
Uh, kitchen?
Yeah.
I'll help
you with that, sir.
Thanks.
Oh, come
on in, come on in.
Well, if it isn't
our mystery bidder.
Happy holidays, Bennett-Songs!
Hey, what's up?
My heart is just
so full of blessings
of this family and,
that little one.
How about you, how was
your Christmas morning?
Oh, I think our Christmas
morning was great.
I mean, gifts were
well-received, right?
What is going on?
After all the
trauma to my hands
and in my eyes,
I had to go and get
a fresh manicure.
Oh my god!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.
What?
You guys were dating?
Uh, yeah.
How did I
not know about this?
You were busy with
a few things around here, bro,
it's all good.
Great.
Hi, Merry Christmas.
Can we say that?
Of course.
And happy holidays
and happy Hanukkah.
What's up?
Well, I have a
holiday surprise.
I like surprises.
Are you
free on New Year's?
I should be yeah, but
don't you have to be in New York
doing what you do?
Well, I begged to
be the one to tell you
that the label booked
us to perform our duet
when I appear on New
Year's Ball Spectacular.
Like in New York?
Wait.
What duet?
The one I thought
I'd work on tomorrow
and finish writing with you.
By the way, the label
loves your songs.
They wanna put the
duet on your album.
That's amazing.
Hey, rock star.
Yeah?
I'll see you tomorrow
Happy holidays.
Happy holidays.
Who wants to chaperone
me to New York
for the ball drop?

23,A Better Tomorrow (1986) - full transcript,"This story is the tale of two brothers: one a successful counterfeiter and the younger a fledgling graduate of the HK police academy. The plot revolves around the split when the younger brother learns the other is a criminal and the efforts of the criminal brother to reform. Along the way are plenty of heists, double-crosses, and shoot outs.","Kit!
Kit!
-Two Hong Kong dollars?
-Yes.
-Mark.
-I'm coming.
You forgot the plate.
Hurry.
Sir.
Tastes good?
Are you all right?
Take it and go to the doctor.
Thanks.
You can read it?
What?
Stop pretending.
Good.
Your English has improved.
You know how to say, ""Of course.""
-Good morning, Mark.
-Good morning, Mr. Sung.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Mr. Sung.
-Mr. Sung.
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Mr. Mark.
""Mr. Mark."" I like that.
Mr. Yiu.
-Ho, you're back. Is everything okay?
-Yes.
-I did the counting already.
-Smart.
Those foreigners are easy-going.
Not all of them are as nice as they seem.
You believe in people too easily.
Thanks.
You are Shing? Have a seat.
Thanks, but I'll be fine standing.
Good morning, Linda.
What a waste.
Shing, you can learn a lot from Ho.
He's a good lad.
But I'll never be as good as him.
Mark might be flirtatious,
but he is loyal.
Yes, he takes good care of me.
-What were you talking about?
-Nothing. We were just talking about you.
Really?
Your brother, Kit, is graduating today.
Oh, right!
I forgot to buy him a present.
I've got to go now.
Ho.
Take Shing with you to Taiwan tomorrow.
Give the kid a chance.
We're going to Taiwan.
You think it's Chai Wan?
I've been in this business for years,
but Taiwan still scares me shitless.
Let me tell you why.
The fighting is insane, the drinking too.
Don't fool with him.
Yes.
Give Kit a hooker as a graduation present.
I'm no good,
but I want him to be a good citizen.
It's better than a booty call.
I want to be there when he gets his PhD,
when he gets married...
...and when he gets a baby.
You'll have to work hard then,
like a buffalo.
It's said that those with a big mouth
will step on shit
when they get in the elevator.
Please.
-No, you first!
-No!
Let's get in together.
Don't move! I'm a cop.
-Let me search you.
-Sir.
Freeze.
-That's not funny.
-Face the wall.
We both have guns.
If you don't respect me,
I won't respect you either.
Let's see who's got more respect, then...
You're so ticklish.
Don't...
Please...
Are you sure?
I have some good news, Ho.
You'll be surprised.
I'm an inspector now.
Surprise!
You have to work hard, then.
You need to become a superintendent.
Jackie.
She's my girlfriend.
She takes care of Dad when she has time.
My brother.
She's taking care of Dad this way.
-Thank you.
-No problem.
I've got to go to an interview.
A new girlfriend again?
So you're serious this time?
Let's see how she performs at night...
You said you'll come with me.
Hurry up.
I really want to pick up Dad, but...
Oh, please. Stop it. Go.
-I'm really going, then.
-Go on.
Sorry.
-Let's go.
-Quick.
Ho.
Dad.
You should quit.
Your brother doesn't know
what you have been doing.
I still remember that
you used to play Cops and Robbers
where you were little.
Even if your brother lost the game,
he still begged you
to let him play as the cop.
I don't want you to play
that game with your brother.
I beg you, quit this game for him.
Please?
Okay.
That's better.
I'm sorry for being late.
The traffic was so bad.
-Yes! The traffic was awful.
-I am Jackie.
-Sir, the traffic was bad.
-Please let me play.
Please let her play.
Are you okay? Be careful, you're pregnant.
-That's right.
-I'm fine.
Please believe me,
the traffic was terrible.
-Would you give her a chance, please?
-Fine, okay.
He said yes. Get on the stage!
How could they do that to you?
A pregnant woman?
Listen, judges.
Sorry.
You made me look like a fool on stage.
You are useless.
How can I help you
when you don't believe in yourself?
They didn't say you're out.
How do you know you're doomed?
-Give it back to me.
-Let go!
I am really doomed this time.
You've made up your mind?
This will be my last deal.
Because of Kit?
Don't come with me to Taiwan tomorrow.
I need you to take care of things
in Hong Kong, in case anything goes wrong.
You'll be responsible for our men
from now on.
I can't handle it.
Let Shing do it.
He looks just like Al Pacino.
Don't fool with me, Mr. Mark.
Mr. Ho, we are nothing without you.
I still have a lot to learn from you.
It's not about what we want.
Reading books about the underworld
doesn't make you a boss.
Have you had a gun pointed at your head?
I bet not.
Twelve years ago...
It's 12 years, right?
Twelve years ago, Ho and I went
to Indonesia for the first time.
We had dinner with them in a nightclub.
I said something wrong.
Before I knew it,
two guns were pointed at me
and I was demanded to drink
a whole bottle of whiskey.
I was so scared that I wet myself.
Ho had my back.
He drank the whole bottle for me.
But things took a sharp turn.
Four guns were pointed at me after that.
Do you know what they asked me to drink?
Urine.
They asked me to drink urine in a club.
That's what I call learning from a pro.
That was our first deal.
What's past is past.
Don't talk about it anymore.
I must continue.
I have never cried since I was a kid.
That was the first time I cried.
I swore that I would never let anyone
point a gun at me again.
See? I can fight!
Be careful.
You need to hit the sandbag more often.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Going somewhere again?
I'll be back soon.
Take care of Dad when I am away.
I will.
Take care.
Yes.
They're coming.
Be careful. Something's wrong.
How do you know?
Intuition.
-Mr. Sung, we've been waiting for you.
-Where's Mr. Wang?
He's not feeling well. I'm his nephew.
He asked me to go for him.
It's nice to meet you.
How ill is he?
Mr. Sung, let's go in and talk.
It's nothing serious.
He's just hiding out for a while.
Have a seat. Come.
Thanks.
Mr. Sung, this way, please.
When you get old,
you'll be scared of everything.
Please, have a seat.
Let's get straight to business.
Attention, headquarters.
Please look up a car.
Plate number, Taipei 1086379.
It might be associated
with suspicious activities.
We know you're reliable,
I respected you when I was a kid.
Can you believe it?
Someone paid me double to kill you.
He's crazy. I would never do that.
I'll give you the money now.
The police are here.
Hello.
Uncle.
Sung killed some of our men in Taiwan.
He is now wanted by the police.
The boss is worried that Ho
might expose our secret.
Please come with me.
I don't want to hurt you.
You son of a bitch.
If you hurt my son,
I won't let you off.
Run!
Stop!
No!
Don't push me.
-Hello?
-Hey, Ling...
Wrong number.
Let's run, Uncle!
Uncle!
Jackie, what's happening?
Be careful, Kit.
Dad, don't come out.
-Dad, stay where you are.
-I'll kill you.
-Stop!
-Die.
Dad.
Dad.
Dad.
Kit...
Please forgive your brother...
Who betrayed me?
Is it you?
Ho, if I had betrayed you,
I wouldn't be here with you right now.
I might not make it out alive this time.
Ho, what are you doing?
Ho.
-I need to turn myself in.
-Ho. Don't go.
Please don't.
Please don't go outside.
No, Ho. Please don't.
Stay away from me.
Ho...
Go away.
I don't want to drag another person
into this.
-I heard gunshots in the cavern.
-Go!
Run!
No.
Run, it's an order!
Stand. Don't move.
Put down the gun.
Did you hear me? Put down your gun.
COUNTERFEIT MONEY SMUGGLERS
OPEN FIRE AT EACH OTHER
Loyalty is a thing of the past.
You can't trust anyone these days.
Even my nephew, Wang,
betrayed me.
He teamed up with a new gang
from Hong Kong
and tried to take over my business.
We sacrificed Ho.
We respect a faithful man,
but not a traitor.
Hello.
Yes.
He will be in the Fung Lim Restaurant
tonight.
What are you going to do?
Do you need any help?
Do you need my men?
Take care.
Thanks.
FONG LAM KOK
-Chief.
-What's this?
-Chief. In here.
-Chief.
I'm not scared.
My boss will post bail for me.
If you have the guts,
fight with me without a gun.
Let's see who is stronger?
5703.
Sir, what's happening?
Nothing.
Sung, what's the charge?
Drug trafficking, attacking the police.
How dare you insult Inspector Sung!
Take down his statement.
Thanks.
Why is that?
This feels different.
Can I give you a lift?
No, thanks. We are not going the same way.
I admire you.
You kept quiet because of your friends.
That's ridiculous. You were behind bars.
The counterfeiting business
is still going strong.
Thanks.
I'm not involved anymore.
Tell your friends.
The case is still open.
I won't let him off.
A bad guy for a day
will never be a good guy again.
Bye.
I'll never come back.
JIANG SU
GRAVE OF SUNG GONG JING
Stop!
Kit, calm down.
Stop fighting.
Kit, stop.
Don't let me see you again.
Manager!
Get to work.
There's no manager here.
I'm Ken. Are you looking for me?
Mr. Chung asked me to come see you.
-When I was doing business in Taiwan...
-Doing business? You were in jail.
Mr. Chung asked me
to give you this letter.
Chung, he never does anything good.
But we are friends.
It's so difficult
for an ex-con to get a job.
No one will hire an ex-con.
-Don't feel depressed.
-Right.
All these guys were prisoners before.
Doing business? That's a piece of cake.
Some people like adopting orphans,
I like taking care of ex-cons.
It's because I was in prison, too.
Everybody, here's the new guy.
Take care of him.
He is... You are...
Sung Tse Ho.
Mr. Ho.
-Just call me Ho.
-Mr. Ho.
A social gathering?
Back to work.
I'm not paying you to do nothing.
-Do you have a driver's license?
-No.
Whether you pass the exam or not,
you can stay.
Thanks, Ken.
Don't mention it.
There's no boss here.
-Take this for your lunch.
-Thanks.
Mark.
This isn't what you told me
in your letter.
Mark, even if I break my legs,
I won't be able to repay you.
It's not your fault.
I'm so glad to see you again.
I haven't seen you for so long.
You still look the same.
Mark.
This isn't our world anymore.
Why are you still here?
I've waited for you for three years.
Let's start all over again.
Don't bother me.
Pay attention to your brother.
He's following Shing every day.
It's very dangerous.
You're brothers.
Kit, we all know you are good at your job.
I recommended your promotion,
but it was rejected.
Why?
This guy, you know him very well.
He disappeared three years ago.
He's back after being released
from prison in Taiwan.
He got back with his old partners.
It's none of my business.
We're investigating underworld activities
and none of their family members
have a connection.
Understand?
Whenever I carried out the tasks,
I've never thought of my brother.
Kit.
You're not on Shing's case anymore.
Or else you'll spoil everything.
Sung, Shing will meet the Thai tonight...
Nam.
-Bottoms up.
-Men, let's all drink.
Mark. Tell us your stories.
Let Ho tell them.
My boss says it's 18 million
Hong Kong dollars, maximum.
Okay.
Boss, Ho is outside.
Draught beer, please.
This way, please.
Ho.
How come you didn't tell us you're back?
You shouldn't do that.
We were good brothers once.
Is that right, Mark?
Ho, if you didn't take care of me,
I would never have what I have now.
Oh, no.
You deserve it.
I don't have the ability.
Mark gave me the chance.
Mark, if you need my help in the future,
just say so.
Don't talk bullshit. Let's drink.
You have to take care of our brothers.
-Cheers!
-Cheers!
This is for my leg.
Come see me when you're free.
There's a lot we can talk about.
I'm not interested.
You will be.
I have to go.
Sung Tse Ho.
Follow me.
What are you doing?
What did Shing tell you?
Bullshit.
Don't fool me!
Was it business or bullshit?
It was bullshit, really.
Is there something arriving the day after?
I don't know.
Where to load and when?
I don't know.
How can you be a boss and know nothing?
Kit!
Don't call me Kit, call me inspector!
I'm not a boss anymore.
Where do you work?
United Taxi.
It's a decent business.
You rob people in a taxi?
Where do you live?
United Taxi.
So someone still accepted you, thief.
""Thief."" Doesn't he have a name?
Don't think you are great
just because you have a gun.
I'll shoot you down, cripple.
Don't point your gun at my head.
If you have the guts,
shoot me!
Kit.
Sir, I know I owe you too much.
Give me a chance.
Give you a chance?
I begged you to give me one.
Do you know that, because of you,
I lost my chance at a promotion?
It's because you are a member
of the triad.
Don't leave Hong Kong.
I'll be back to get you.
Do you need an invitation
for a cup of tea?
-Thanks!
-Thanks!
I will deduct it from your salary.
You are mean.
Otherwise, how can I support my family?
-You're right.
-That's mine.
Thanks.
Hey.
There's a beautiful girl staring at you.
Please, come in.
No.
I want your help.
Can you leave Hong Kong for a while?
I don't want to see Kit get mad.
He can't take this pressure,
and neither can I.
I think it's better for you
to be away for a while.
I won't leave.
I want Kit to see me living a new life.
Can you give me a chance
to show it to him?
Don't you see that I want to skate
and ride a bicycle with him, too?
I don't want to lose him.
-Ho.
-Ho.
Don't stay here, go in.
It's useless to stay here.
Ho can handle this. Go in.
Who are they?
Not good.
Ho, the boss wants to see you.
I'm busy.
Don't embarrass me.
Just come with us.
-Hello?
-Ho, Mark is with us.
Come over as well.
No, thanks. I am not interested.
You may not be interested in the business,
but what about your brother?
Doesn't he interest you?
I'll be waiting for you.
Okay.
Ken, I want to go out for a while.
You have to have a principle.
Don't be afraid.
Be good.
Ho, please.
You'll never be clean
once you've belonged to the underworld.
Ho.
Ho.
Ho, I'm so glad you're back.
How are you, Mr. Yiu?
Fine, thanks.
Come, talk to Shing.
Not you?
It's the same as talking to Shing.
I'm too old to make decisions.
Ho, please sit.
We can make big money.
I really hope to work with you again.
How?
You're still our boss.
Mark handles the trafficking of money.
I'll take care of the drugs
and make money for our company.
We need you to contact the old clients.
You haven't gotten to the point yet.
And with your brother's assistance,
it will be perfect.
What's better than having
your own man in the police?
Come, I have something to tell you.
How about I don't accept?
Ho,
I kept Mark because of you.
Your brother is following everything.
If it wasn't for you,
he'd be dead already.
Shing,
one is my brother, the other is my friend.
How could I walk out this door
if I said yes?
I don't care if you insult me,
but don't insult my friend.
If you hurt my brother,
you won't live for long.
We've wanted Mark Lee
for three years,
but we can't take him back legally.
Otherwise,
we can control the syndicate.
We've gotten some information recently.
In two days, there will be
counterfeit money
and 500kg of heroin shipped to Taiwan.
Though I can't do this case myself,
I hope to see
Mark and his men charged with it.
Boss, Ho is too much.
Let's kill him.
That's not necessary.
Just do as we've planned.
I gave you the money already.
Where do we load the thing?
I'll give you the address.
-Get in.
-We'll continue inside.
Welcome back.
Did you have dinner yet?
What are you doing?
Mr. Mok, it's Kit.
I've got some information.
The Thai will deal with Shing tomorrow.
The time and location should be...
Okay, hand in the information tomorrow
and don't concern yourself with this.
Why?
You are not involved.
I'm afraid that
you'll spoil the whole thing.
Give me a chance.
I have told you
that there is no hero in the police.
What are you doing now?
Do you know that today is my birthday?
Can you look at me?
You'll look at the vase.
This is your home,
not the police barracks.
You even forgot my birthday.
Jackie.
I didn't forget.
Blow out the candles.
What wish did you make?
You really want to know?
What is it?
Promise not to get angry.
Say it.
A reunion between the two of you.
Don't be angry.
I won't.
Don't get angry on my birthday.
I won't let you get angry.
Otherwise, I will get angry.
Smile.
I'll get it.
Did something happen?
I want to speak to Kit.
Who is it?
Don't be mad.
Keep your promise.
Sit.
Thanks.
Today is your birthday?
Yes.
Have some cake.
Why do you treat him that well?
Don't do that.
I don't care how you treat me.
I'm here to tell you something.
Shing is trying to trap you.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Don't trust those scum.
It's always going to be a trap
if you have it too easy.
Do you think I am as dumb as before?
I only want to help you.
Help me or trick me?
Do you know that I'm burdened
because of you?
Can't you trust me for one last time?
-Trust you? That's how I lost Dad.
-Kit.
Jackie!
Ho.
His impression of me didn't change a bit.
Don't give up.
Don't let him look down on you.
Why can't you forgive him?
Let him start a new life?
Because he killed Dad indirectly!
Why are you forcing me to accept him?
He can't blame anyone
for choosing the wrong way.
I'm the cop. He's the thief.
We're going in opposite directions.
I'm a cop.
What's happening? Ken!
Your brother is having an operation.
He's now at Queen Margaret's. Hurry up!
Okay.
What happened to my brother?
He was trapped by Shing.
He did it on purpose.
How is he?
You can't get in.
I tried to stop him,
but he insisted.
I hope you can cooperate with the police
and inform us of your location.
It's easy to be a hero.
Jump.
It's not the same.
Now, you don't have any choice.
Cooperate with us.
Don't tell the police.
We know each other well.
What are you doing?
Hey!
What's happening?
Don't use Sung ever again.
Stop!
Beat them up!
Stop it!
Let's talk it over.
Stop fighting!
It's not worth it to break the law again.
Stop fighting!
Stop!
Run!
You idiot. Don't go!
Stay if you have the guts!
You son of a bitch!
Ken. This is my fault.
I don't want you to be involved.
You have no principle.
They fight because they are scared.
If you fight back, they win.
Why do you want to change?
Why?
Who is he?
Ken! Ho!
Come and have a look.
Come over here.
Mark!
-Mark!
-He's hurt.
Mark!
The first aid kit.
-Quick!
-Get me the first aid kit!
Ken, what are we going to do?
Let's go!
Go!
Police. Stop. We're going to search you.
That's too much.
I'll send the quotation to the station.
Smart.
Hurry.
I didn't notice that Hong Kong
is so beautiful at night.
But it doesn't last.
It's not worthwhile.
Ho.
Let's start all over again.
After this,
let's leave Hong Kong gloriously.
Mark.
We've never been scared before.
Why are we scared of Shing?
Don't push me.
I'll never get involved again.
That was the past.
I'm still alive.
Even if you do this ten times,
a hundred times...
What then?
Even if you kill Shing?
I lost my brother already.
I don't want to lose you, too.
Mark, why don't you wake up?
I don't want any sympathy.
You didn't owe me anything?
I've never forced my friends
to do things unwillingly.
I have my principles.
I don't want to be a loser
for my entire life.
Do you think I like begging?
I've waited for a chance for three years.
I have to show them that,
though I may not be the best,
I will take back whatever I've lost!
What do you think you look like?
We were scared when we were bad.
Now, we feel as if we are being followed
when we are good.
Did you fight for a chance?
You didn't.
You didn't!
I don't want to be like you.
Mark.
What happened to you?
I just want to take something back.
Stand on that side.
Go and get the plate.
You'll be in big trouble.
-Think twice before you do it.
-Stop.
Stop for a moment.
Run.
Open the door.
Thanks, Mr. Chan.
Go after them!
You idiot!
I told you, that's too much.
Idiot.
If Ho hands the plate to the police,
not only will you die,
but the syndicate will also collapse.
That's enough. Don't call me an idiot.
What did you call me
when I made money for you?
I regret having you.
I'll kill you if you don't
bring me back the plate.
Kill me, then.
I betrayed Ho three years ago.
Would I be scared of him now?
You have to pay him back.
We have to share this problem together.
Hello.
Ho, why did you give me such a problem?
Mr. Yiu, I want to speak to Shing.
Shing? Wait a minute.
Beg him to give us back the plate.
Ho, don't fool me.
We can make a compromise.
At 10 p.m. tonight, go to the temple
with two million US dollars.
Exchange it for the plate.
And have a boat ready for you at The Bay.
It's that simple?
I want cash.
Bring it yourself.
I will be there.
What did Ho say?
What did he say?
What?
He said he wants to have dinner with you.
Okay, I'll wait for him.
Sir.
Sir.
Come in.
Mr. Mok, I have some information.
Ho, Mark, and Shing had a quarrel.
They blackmailed Shing.
They have a deal tonight.
Do you know the time and place?
Later.
Hello. I'm...
Thanks.
Two minutes ago,
Shing withdrew two million US dollars
from the bank.
Everyone, get ready for your orders.
Mr. Mok. Let me join in.
You should be in the hospital.
What are you doing here?
I'm fine.
You're on paid leave for a few days.
See, I can lift the chair easily.
You're not on the case.
My brother is the thief, not me.
Why do you pressure me?
If you still remember the rules,
you shouldn't get involved.
-My dad died three years ago.
-Your brother is the mastermind.
-But you two are brothers.
-I know this case
-very well.
-Don't pressure me.
I want to lock him up myself!
I'll lock him up.
I'll lock him up!
Kit. Be practical.
Jackie.
I'm leaving Hong Kong tonight.
You are giving up.
Can you give
this packet to Kit tonight at nine?
It's very important to him.
Will you come back?
Kit, your brother is leaving tonight.
He asked me to give this packet to you.
Kit. The plate I gave you
is evidence to charge Shing.
We have a deal tonight at The Bay.
You can put me in prison if you want.
I decided not to stay in Hong Kong.
What are you doing?
I have to get him.
No. You can't.
-Let go.
-No.
Go away!
Kit...
Kit...
Ho. They are late.
Do you know what to say?
Do you believe in the gods?
I'm a god.
God is human.
Anyone can be a god
if he can control his fate.
But sometimes you can't.
You'll either win or lose.
Hold it.
The money?
The plate?
It was handed to the police.
Don't.
There's a bomb.
I'm not dumb.
Are you scared?
How will you take me on, then?
Shit!
After Ho arrived,
he had a quarrel with Master.
He asked for two million US dollars.
He'll be at sea tonight.
Then I heard a gunshot.
That's him.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Do you want to be a witness?
Yes.
I know you would do that already.
You'll lose.
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
You'll let him go if you're smart.
Come over here.
Go!
Ho, on board.
You go first.
You said we'll go together.
I've got something to do.
I'll meet up with you.
Mark.
Go.
I'll wait for you.
Release him.
Otherwise, I'll kill your brother.
Don't do it.
It's one for one.
Go!
-Go.
-Go!
I won't let you off.
I know.
Kit!
Come over here!
You.
Look at your brother.
Look!
No matter how he has wronged you before,
he has paid you back now.
He has the guts to change.
What can't you forgive him?
Why?
For a brother...
-Shing!
-Ho!
You can't go over there, miss.
Shing!
Ho, you're being surrounded.
You have three minutes.
Come out unarmed.
No more bullets.
I'm going to surrender.
I'll be all right.
But you won't.
I will have money three days later.
I'll be released.
I have money.
I can change from black to white.
I learned that from you.
But your brother,
because of you,
he's turned from white to black.
You've dragged him down.
Kit.
You were not wrong.
We just chose different paths.
You went the right way.
I was wrong before.
I want to be back on the right path now."
24,A Better Tomorrow II (1987) - full transcript,"Restaurant owner Ken Gor, twin brother of Mark Gor, teams up with police detective Kit and his struggling ex-con brother Ho to avenge his old friend's daughter's death by a Triad gang.","I've waited for a chance for three years.
I have to show them that,
though I may not be the best,
I will take back whatever I've lost.
Kit, calm down!
Don't call me Kit, call me Inspector!
Yes, Inspector.
I'm not a boss anymore.
For a brother...
Kit.
You were not wrong.
We just chose different paths.
You went the right way.
Let me introduce you.
This is Chief Inspector Wu.
-And Inspector Chow.
-Ho.
Take a seat.
We have a case, which, hopefully,
you will agree to take up.
Interpol has information
that the headquarters
of an international counterfeit operation
has moved here.
It's a fact.
I want to solve this case
before I retire.
The few big operators,
we've already finished them off.
Only this suspect is left.
The one who taught you everything, Lung.
Fifteen years ago, Lung ruled over
all counterfeit operations
in Southeast Asia.
We have not concluded
-whether or not he is still in control.
-Impossible!
He has been retired for over ten years.
Are you that sure?
He's not that kind of person.
He can change the way he looks,
but he can never get rid
of his criminal record.
Ho, you were in the business.
I want you to work undercover
and investigate Lung.
I won't do it.
That's a fact.
Don't you want to do something
for society?
I'm giving back now.
I think I've done my part for society.
Mr. Lung!
-Daddy, I'm scared.
-Don't be afraid.
-Mr. Lung!
-How do you do?
How are you?
Good evening.
Hi, how are you?
Ko.
Lung.
My daughter is very nervous.
There's no need to be.
I taught you right.
Your mother and I danced
like this 20 years ago.
Everyone was applauding,
from the first step to the last.
Sometimes, you have to wait
a long time for the first clap.
If you did your best,
someone will appreciate it.
This way, please.
No, thank you.
Excuse me, do you know Mr. Lung?
Yes, what's the matter?
Well, I worship him.
You worship him?
I also enjoy
watching people dance like this.
I saw him dance 20 years ago.
At that time,
not many people could dance like this.
So he was quite the sensation.
I would really like to meet him.
I'll introduce you.
Someone wants to meet you, Dad.
A secret admirer.
I heard that and it hurt me a little.
I'm sorry. I'm Billie.
I couldn't recognize you.
It's all right.
But are you certain
I'm your idol from 20 years ago?
Actually, you haven't changed
that much in 20 years.
Stay calm.
Dad, my heel has broken off.
Why are you so clumsy?
What should I do?
Joe, think of something.
Take your shoes off.
-What are you doing?
-Come on.
The judges will feel sorry for you
without your shoes on.
Go on.
Take a seat.
CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT
I can't tell anyone
about the case I'm on.
Not even you.
Don't worry, I'll be all right.
Take care.
Wong.
Lung, Mr. Wong would like to say hello.
Lung!
Wong.
Good!
Your daughter dances well.
No one will wear shoes next year.
Ms. Lung.
LUNG SHIPYARD
My dad talks too much. Don't talk to him.
Sir!
Billie is here to see you, Dad.
-Really?
-Sir.
Billie.
-Why don't you two chat a little?
-Okay.
This is for you,
to wish you ""smooth sailing.""
The business wasn't going so well.
With this, it should be better now.
I'll put it away for you.
Do you like the ship?
Sure. This nice young man, too.
Billie says he wants to tour the shipyard.
Yes, to learn a little about shipyards.
I'm glad you're friends with Peggy.
As long as she's happy,
I'll be grateful to you.
We cannot repay the bank.
The shipyard could be repossessed anytime.
How much cash do we have
to pay off the staff?
Not even a third of what's needed.
What are you listening to?
You want to listen?
They say someone has applied
for a winding up order.
The only way out is to give up
your shares and get some cash
to tide us over.
Hey!
Are you listening to me?
Yes.
Mr. Lung.
What is it?
I've come to deliver the money to you.
Lung, I've used all my shares
to act as collateral
against Mr. Wong's bonds.
I've done my best for the company.
If you let me have your shares too,
I'll withdraw the winding up order.
Who are you to decide that?
In our time, we had a code of behavior.
You respect me,
and the respect returned is double.
Ko might have had a lapse of judgment,
he did this without consulting me.
You are not worthy of my respect
nor my disdain.
Please leave.
Seems there's nothing more to say.
Nobody would dare not to give me face.
Ho!
I haven't seen Kit for a long time.
He seems to be a changed person.
He says he's on a special mission.
When he's done,
we'll change our names and identities,
and move somewhere else.
-Did he say what kind of mission he's on?
-No, but he's become very strange.
He was talking late last night
with a girl named Peggy.
I'm afraid he'll leave me.
Why did you send Kit
as an undercover agent?
Don't you know he'll be in danger?
Kit has his own mindset.
No one can stop him.
Okay, I'll work with you.
Take Kit off this case.
Let me think about it.
Sung Tse Ho, remember,
I didn't force you, you volunteered.
We all have to be responsible
for what happens next.
When am I getting out?
I'll arrange it.
Sir.
How did you get out?
I escaped.
I have nowhere to go.
I want to stay with you.
Give yourself up.
If a man did something wrong,
he should face the consequences
with his head held high.
I've left this business
many years ago already.
I want to go straight.
But someone is always after us.
I want to be clean,
but no one believes me.
You should have another choice.
-Wong!
-Mr. Chow.
Thanks for coming.
Emigrating so soon?
Let's not talk about it.
-Chung.
-Hello.
Mr. Chow.
-Just help yourself.
-Congratulations...
Chan.
When you aren't doing well,
everybody looks at you like an exhibit.
So you should look at them the same way.
That's true.
I'm over it.
Dad says that, out of all my boyfriends,
-you're the most considerate.
-Really?
He loves the boat you gave him.
He asked me to thank you.
Excuse me for a minute.
Kit!
Excuse me.
Wong!
Ho.
My name is Billie.
Billie.
What are you doing here?
I'm doing exactly what you're doing.
What have you found out?
Come.
What about you?
Wong and two gangs
want to get Lung's shipyard.
I don't know why yet.
Get out of this.
Let me handle it.
You can't fight them.
I've already started this mission.
I must finish it.
I've done this before.
I know what will happen.
I used to be too irrational.
Maybe, after this,
I'll understand you better.
You're still so stubborn.
You all know my problem.
There's a note for you, sir.
LUNG, I'M WAITING FOR YOU AT THE VIP ROOM.
FROM: WONG
When I drop my cigarette, shoot.
Lung!
Lung...
I'm right here, what do you want?
Don't get so mad.
I just want your company to pay up.
What game are you playing?
You fooled me with cheap tricks.
-You have no ethics.
-Shut up!
You have no right to speak.
You...
Mr. Wong, I'll be responsible
for Ko's case.
The law will settle this.
The law? The law is up to me.
It's simple,
either sign these documents
or take this bullet, up to you.
I don't believe
you have the guts to shoot.
You don't believe me?
Neither of us is that clean.
Why don't we bet on it?
-I'll be responsible. Leave Lung out.
-Ko!
-Ko, don't!
-Settle the matter with me.
-Step back.
-No!
-Move over, let me kill him.
-Stop!
What is it?
Somebody is in danger.
-Go and check it out! Yes.
-Really?
-You...
-Put your gun down.
Step aside, Lung!
You think I have no ethics.
Ko, listen to me.
-We can't solve things this way.
-No!
Lung, let go!
Don't!
Let me kill him.
Be careful!
Put the gun down.
Ko, don't!
Lung!
Put it down!
Kit, take Peggy away. Look after her.
Run!
Lung, let's go!
Do you know what you just did?
You killed someone.
I just want to know if you're innocent.
He's just putting the blame on someone.
It's no good.
No one believes him.
Everybody is after him.
He has to leave town.
Please, do something.
This is against my principles.
But principles can be changed.
I do have a way.
I can put him on a boat tonight.
Thank you!
I'm putting you on a boat tonight, Lung.
What about my daughter?
I'll look after Peggy.
You can rest assured.
Do you have any friends overseas?
Yes.
In New York.
Fine, as long as you have a friend.
Why don't you take me home?
Your home is not safe.
My girlfriend, Peggy.
My wife, Jackie.
Don't go!
You lied to me.
Calm down. Go inside.
-Let go of me.
-Go inside.
Let go!
Don't be like that.
Sit down.
I lied, but I didn't do it to hurt you.
I'm with the police.
We suspected
your father was trading illegally.
That's why I had to get close to you.
You used me!
Trust me.
It's safer here.
You had better explain.
What were you up to?
Tell me!
Thank you.
Go, don't worry.
We should let Peggy meet up
with Lung in the USA.
And you?
I'll try to join them.
They won't trust you.
I'll try anyway.
Watch out for Ko, he's real trouble.
You take care too.
I will.
I DON'T WANT TO RUIN YOUR MARRIAGE
I'M GOING HOME
DON'T LOOK FOR ME
You really don't know
where your father is?
I don't.
Have any of his friends said where he is?
No.
Peggy!
Ho, Peggy is dead.
Many things are memorable.
I've turned all the events of your lives
into many heroic stories.
There's nothing worth writing about.
That's not true.
Nowadays, the world lacks camaraderie.
The friendship you shared was precious.
People like Mark,
how many people are there like him?
Who is he? He looks just like Mark.
He's Ken,
Mark's twin brother.
He's a real tough one.
He used to be called
""King of Diamond Hill.""
People trembled when they heard his name.
But he straightened himself out
and traveled all over.
At 15, he landed in the US,
and traveled from the West Coast
to the East Coast.
He continued being clean.
Everybody respected him.
He's gutsy, all right.
I'm Sung Tse Ho, calling from Hong Kong.
Can I speak to Ken?
Sure, wait a minute.
Ken will scold you for dressing like that.
So what?
Let's sit there.
Ken!
Table number 10.
There's a call from Sung Tse Ho
from Hong Kong. Are you taking it?
Tell him I'm busy.
He has to hold the call.
Those two said the dish was too salty
and they want it changed.
I'll change it. Take this out first.
Keung.
I've got a lawyer working on your papers.
You can apply for your family soon.
Thank you, Ken!
Don't mention it.
Go easy on the salt in the fried rice.
Those customers are really making a fuss.
I will. I was just worried
about being caught, so I lost focus.
I won't anymore.
RED EAGLE GANG
How does this look?
What is it?
-Ken!
-Ken!
You got a cold? Have you gone blind?
You deserve it.
I told you Ken would scold you.
We just wanted to imitate Mark
who was so manly.
-We aren't blind.
-You two.
We just want to stick with a boss in town.
You won't take us.
Look at you.
All of you are like circus clowns.
Take those off and have some soup.
Good. Great.
What soup will they serve today?
Hey, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Keung, bring two more plates
of fried rice.
Again?
Go on!
Damn those foreigners.
Ken, Bobby has a gun.
Here.
My rice is good.
-It tastes good.
-Ken...
Fuck off!
What are you doing? Stop it!
Eat up, you bastard.
-Eat, you asshole.
-Eat up!
Drop it.
Eat it up, damn you!
If you don't, I'll blow your head off.
Eat up, come on!
When we parted 15 years ago,
you said to look for you
if I got in trouble.
I didn't think
you would come looking for me.
Lung.
Sam.
It seemed so easy to kill someone before.
Yet it seems so difficult
to save someone now.
But I believe in one thing.
If you are determined to be a good man,
you'll make it.
You brat.
Come, wash your hands.
A tattoo of over ten years
cannot be washed away.
Some regular parishioners
dare not come in because of it.
Hello?
Hello, Ko!
Lung. Oh, good. Where are you now?
I'm in New York.
How are things?
Things will clear up soon.
I am collecting evidence.
How about my daughter?
She misses you.
I'll arrange for her to see you.
Do that as quickly as possible.
Give me your address.
Don't worry, I'll handle everything.
Take care of yourself.
He's in New York.
God bless him.
He's a sitting duck.
Let's continue.
How much more counterfeit do you need?
I need 60 million Hong Kong dollars
to supply Europe and South America.
How do you intend to ship the money out?
We have our own ships.
Great. That reassures me.
It's the same price, 38 Hong Kong dollars
for 100 notes.
Sam, I'll be able to see my daughter soon.
That's wonderful.
I told you not to worry.
-This is for you. It's good.
-Okay.
Sam!
Save me!
Lung!
Lung!
Lung!
Lung.
Lung, we're home.
Dinner time.
I bet you haven't had
such a sumptuous meal
since you came to the States.
Here, a sausage. It's not poisonous.
A chicken leg!
Nail you down.
You're dead.
-Diamond 2.
-What?
-Got any more 2's?
-Get him!
A Mr. Sung is here to see you.
CEO'S ROOM
I want to see Mr. Ko.
Ho?
When did you get out?
It's nice of you to visit us.
You really give me face.
He's the one who shot Shing.
The whole business knows about it.
-You speak too highly of me.
-This is Mr. Ko.
Mr. Ko.
What can I do for you?
I used to work for Mr. Lung.
He took good care of me.
Now, I've escaped.
I want to work with him again,
but he's skipped town.
It's my bad luck.
I just want to make some money.
So why come looking for me?
I want to join your organization.
You're mistaken.
All our businesses are legitimate.
We both know each other's
background really well.
Did you think I would just turn up
without checking it out?
Why do you speak like that?
If there's money to be made,
let's all make it.
If you're interested, talk to Mr. Ko.
If there's a chance for me to join,
I'll agree with whatever you want.
Then it's settled.
Give us some time to consider it.
We should all check out our credibility.
Hope to speak soon, Mr. Ko.
Okay.
Mrs. Sung.
You should discuss the baby's name
with your husband.
Please come in, Mrs. Cheung.
Hey! How are you?
Hey.
How careless.
That's pretty impressive.
Where are you from?
Do I have to be from somewhere?
Not even a word of thanks?
You want to talk business?
""Talk business""?
Sure.
It won't do you any good if you don't eat.
You're not a baby,
so I won't make you eat.
Feed yourself.
Eat something.
Come on!
It doesn't matter
if we're husband and wife,
brothers, sisters, or whatever.
It's bad enough that I can't help you.
If you think there isn't a single person
left to help you,
why don't you help yourself?
If you want to be ill,
I'll be ill with you.
If you want to give up, I'll give up too.
If you want to starve,
I'll starve with you.
This is shit!
Damn it.
Damn it!
Damn it!
It's sweet.
Eat it.
Eat it...
Good!
Good, right?
-Is that so?
-Listen.
You better not make up stories.
We need to get Ken.
Marco, notify everybody.
-Get everybody here.
-Hurry up!
-We'll get them.
-They're all going to die!
They will die.
There's nothing for you guys here.
Ken!
-Your problem is our problem.
-That's right!
I'm sorry this happened to you guys.
You should all leave.
Kill them all.
Kill them!
Ken.
Ken!
Why, Ken?
Let's go, Lung.
Ken!
-Ken...
-Don't follow me.
Go home.
Let us help you.
You've made up your mind?
Yes.
If there's money to be made,
then we're opening our doors.
I really want to work with you.
Do you trust me now?
Everyone is different,
so it's natural to be cautious.
We must understand one another better,
test our sincerity.
How do we do that?
I want you to get rid of someone for me.
He has been causing me problems.
He says he's one of us,
but I know he's an undercover agent.
I want you to kill him.
Excuse me.
It's Billie.
You just let me know
if you want to make money.
I've always admired you.
Mr. Ko, your status
is somewhat different now.
Talk is cheap. Let's make a deal.
Sure.
Chong.
Billie, I know you're an agent.
You want to get me?
An agent?
If I were one,
I would have killed you already.
I don't need to take this shit.
If you don't believe me, kill me.
Let his wish come true.
You want to play?
Go ahead and shoot me.
Otherwise, I'll go to the police.
Chong!
Let me do it.
Fire another shot
or else he won't believe it.
Do it!
Sung Tse Ho, finish him!
Between the two of us,
it's enough that he trusts one.
Shoot.
Shoot!
Actually,
we haven't investigated this kid.
We just wanted to test you.
Welcome to the company.
Thank you.
Kit.
Kit.
Kit.
Kit.
This is your brother.
-Miss, where is the emergency ward?
-Over there.
Doctor.
Prepare for the operation.
Get him inside, quick.
Get him inside.
Please hurry up, will you?
You can't go in, wait outside.
Ho!
How is Kit?
He's wounded.
The doctors are working on him.
He's okay.
Luckily, the bullet went through.
Don't worry.
What's her name?
Her name.
Your daughter is dead.
She's dead.
Wake up, will you?
Do you want to waste your life like this?
Don't torture yourself.
Everybody will be so hurt
to see you like this.
The Lung of the past
could face anything.
But now, you can't even walk out the door.
Why can't you face reality?
Why?
You might as well be dead.
Everything I've done over the years
was washed away, too.
I have no regrets.
I don't need any sympathy.
I'm not like you,
waiting to die and looking for pity.
I am still in control.
If you do not admit defeat,
stand up and fight with me.
There's no such thing in this world
as being forced.
Get out!
There's only one way out
and you're coming with me.
If we don't fight,
we'll both die here.
If we win, we'll start all over again.
I know you can do it. Come on!
No, don't. Don't make me!
Don't force me!
No...
Peggy.
I'm right here. Don't be afraid.
Dad is right here.
I want to see you.
Peggy!
Ken!
Why...
Why is it so difficult
to be a good person?
This is not our own place after all.
Many try to leave home at all costs.
Many want to go home.
Some...
Some cannot even find
a temporary place to rest.
Home is always better.
Will you come back, Ken?
Sure, to have some soup.
You're so biased,
keeping so many of Mark's things.
Of course, he treated me the best.
Look at this overcoat
with over 40 bullet holes.
It's a reminder for you to behave,
so that you won't come crawling back
in something like it.
Lung!
I've been waiting for you to come back.
Ho!
Look who's here.
-Mark?
-It's Ken!
Ken!
PEGGY LUNG
PEGGY LUNG
I'm sorry, I couldn't protect Peggy.
I can only send her flowers every day.
Thank you.
It's God's will.
Lung,
Kit did his best.
It's been hard for you.
I don't care now.
Why are you looking at me?
You resemble someone.
Someone dead?
Your brother?
Don't speak of the dead in a cemetery.
I'm Sung Tse Ho's brother, Tse Kit.
How are you?
So you're Tse Kit!
Just call me Kit.
I'm Ken!
Hi, Mr. Ken.
Come on, we're both on the same side.
Call me Ken.
What happened? Got hit?
In the line of duty.
Just admit you got hit.
Don't blame the job.
You're a bore, just like your brother.
You're like Mark, too.
You have a sharp tongue.
Kit.
Jackie needs you right now. Go home.
Why don't we let Kit join us?
Maybe he has more information for us.
An extra hand can sure help.
Whatever you say.
I can't figure it out.
What does Ko want with the shipyard?
I suspect he is using it
as a counterfeit hub.
He's going to make Lung the scapegoat.
He doesn't need to kill Lung.
He'll just make him go crazy.
I'll burn up the shipyard.
It's my life's work.
No one can destroy it.
But if it has to be done,
I'll do it myself.
What we need to do is
to get evidence against them
and clear your name.
So, go big or go home.
Got any leads?
A buyer from New York is in town.
He has a deal with Ko.
Find out where their den is
and take them down.
Ken!
Thanks, Lung!
It's very sweet.
Hey!
For you.
I don't like oranges.
What is it?
A shooting star.
It's probably a firefly.
In the police force,
it's unlucky to see a shooting star.
What's the point of knowing you'll die?
The first time I saw it was at a cemetery.
The second time I saw it,
we were together.
Such misfortune.
So what? Are you worried?
I'm not just worried. I'm very worried.
I'm worried
that I might die before it's over.
Do you have a lot of unfinished business?
It's better to go with the flow.
As softly as I left you.
As softly as I came.
Not taking with me,
any trace of the clouds.
Who are those people?
They look like the printers.
Go back to the shipyard
and get them started.
I'll take the delivery tomorrow.
Okay.
-Ho, you go too.
-Okay.
-It's time.
-Let's go!
The boss is here.
-Boss!
-Boss!
Hurry it up.
Get a move on.
How much do you think we'll make?
Enough to buy a few nightclubs, I think.
Hey, you!
You've got the nerve to steal.
Go to hell!
Don't!
What? Get to work.
-Go.
-Watch them closely. They're slacking off.
Clearly, the counterfeit headquarters
is at the shipyard.
Ko has been running it.
Then notify the police
and clear Lung's name.
Right.
It can't be that simple.
I feel like something is wrong.
I saw it myself. Don't you believe me?
No...
Hello?
Ko, this is Lung.
I'm back.
Lung.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Thanks for your concern.
Kit, I would like to talk to you.
Leave this case.
-But--
-I don't want you to get hurt.
-Jackie is in the hospital.
-Really?
She's in room 704.
You know she needs your support
at this time.
Ko Ying Pui.
Go!
What have you found?
There's no one here. We've been had.
Damn.
Mr. Ko, we've notified the police.
You think I really trusted Sung Tse Ho?
I set a few guys up and got rid of them.
Nice and clean.
-You guys need to go.
-Come on.
Use the back door. The police are here.
We want Lung alive.
Hurry, get in!
-You go first.
-Let's go together.
Go on.
Look after Lung!
There's gunfire.
What happened?
Follow me!
Hurry...
Found anything?
Get in.
You've really been hit.
Are you scared?
I'm not just scared. I'm very scared.
Step on it, then.
Ko's basement is really the headquarters.
I finally finished this case.
Yet crime goes on.
So what if you cracked this one?
Someone is bound to carry on.
Right, and you're the one to do it.
Kit.
Stop the car, I have to make a call.
We're almost at the hospital.
There's no time.
Room 704, please.
Ho, this is Ken.
He's fine. He's right beside me.
Put Jackie on the line.
Hello, Jackie? Hold on.
Hello.
Dear.
-Is it a boy or a girl?
-A girl.
It's a girl.
-What's her weight?
-Six pounds and three ounces.
She's beautiful.
She weighs six pounds and three ounces.
She's not very small.
Mark and I weighed
less than six pounds together.
Who does she take after more?
Like me. But she has your eyes.
She says our daughter is beautiful.
-She's got my eyes.
-I can tell from your face.
Bring her over.
I want to talk to her.
Don't be silly. She can't talk yet.
She can only cry.
Let me hear her cries, then.
-Hello?
-Kit.
Hello?
Why aren't you talking?
Oh, I'm just too happy.
Then come quickly, so you can meet her.
I'm on the way.
Hello?
Kit, you haven't thought of a name yet.
Kit.
You need to name your daughter.
Sung...
Ho Yin.
Be careful, mister.
Kit!
Kit...
Go home, Ken.
I can help.
I can find you a getaway boat.
It's not necessary.
Ho, Kit fell from here.
To our partnership.
He must have taken
the wrong medicine today.
These grenades are powerful.
I have to watch out this time.
This place is finished.
Those outside will take care of it.
What? Are you trying to run?
This is for you.
You kill one, you get 100,000.
-What, 100,000?
-Let's go!
Hey.
What kind of bombs are those?
They're so powerful!
Want even more powerful ones?
I'll bring them to you.
I said no!
Ko Ying Pui!
Are you all right?
Give me a gun!
Ho!
Lung!
Ko Ying Pui!
Lung, are you all right?
Ko Ying Pui!
Drop the gun.
You're so serious about everything.
You think a good man
always gets a good ending?
And you think a bad man
always gets a good ending?
Lung, are you all right?
I don't need you to save me.
Yes. We're being terrible.
We're dying. Can we leave?
So leave.
Ken, you should go.
Go on.
Lower your guns.
Inspector Wu, you better not retire.
There's still a lot for you to do.
We miss you, Ken. How are you doing?
We're looking
after the restaurant really well.
There are more customers than before.
You'll be very pleased when you come back.
After you left..."

Vietnam 1974
Sir, Good afternoon.
How's the situation over in Phnompenh?
A lot of personnel changes.
The situation can still
be considered stable.
Sir...
You can't take this money
It's my fault. I've not declared
The money is for live saving.
Please give it back to me!
Sir, please...
Mark
I was supposed to pick you up at the airport...
instead you picked me up at prison!
Where's Dad?
Uncle's waiting for you at the drug store.
Yesterday I almost lost my life at the airport.
If I hadn't paid them off,
we'd be meeting inside the prison.
When those customs officers see money,
their eyes light up like car headlights.
Mark, you went through
a lot of trouble for me.
Pedicab!
It's a good thing they like money.
Otherwise you'd still be rotting in jail.
Bye-bye!
Is that 'goodbye' in Vietnamese?
They don't understand what you're saying!
In Hong Kong, do you know
anything about the war?
We've got a news black-out here,
don't know any thing.
The radio and newspapers all report...
the Viet Cong are very close to the city.
The situation is terrible.
It's good you've come back.
Help me persuade Dad.
He's not convinced that the situation is bad.
You said there's a news black-out here.
How can anybody know what's going on?
The city looks peaceful enough.
Mun, didn't you apply for Uncle's visa?
The line outside Immigration
goes on forever.
You get nowhere without bribes.
The Chinese have been here for decades.
Asking them to shut down their businesses
is worse than killing them.
Why do you think I worked
in the black market?
Only to get him a passport.
And it all came to nothing.
Which one of us gets them?
They're yours!
Hello!
How are you?
Student demonstration. Let's split!
Let's make a fast turn!
End the war!
The pedicab's broken down.
Get off and push!
Great!
Chicken buttocks!
Pat, get the soy sauce.
Uncle, here's some wine.
I put Chinese wine in a foreign brandy bottle.
Almost got confiscated in customs.
Drink up so it won't go to waste.
Yeah!
You're so clever to put the wine
in a brandy bottle.
Mainland Chinese products aren't allowed in.
You have to remove the label
or change the bottle.
Did you go to Mainland China to see your Dad?
How can I go there now?
It's chaos there with
the Cultural Revolution.
Even if I went,
I wouldn't know how to find him.
We've been separated for over ten years.
Uncle, I bought this
at the China Products Store.
This is good wine!
Delicious!
Pat!
Not fish sauce. I hate fish sauce.
I want soy sauce!
The black stuff.
Get going!
Soy sauce.
Who's that kid?
At New Year when the Viet Cong entered Hue,
he was separated from his parents.
I took pity on him and took him in.
When I asked him his name,
he just stammered.
I didn't understand what he said.
So I call him Pat.
Dad!
What was Dad gabbing about?
We need money to get Dad out of here.
I was already arrested by them once.
A second time would be very dangerous.
But there's a war going on.
It's dangerous no matter what you do.
Anyway, nothing ventured nothing gained.
Who are you looking for?
My ex-boss went to Thailand.
When I was in prison,
Chung told me of a new buyer.
A Miss Chow Ying-kit.
I'm familiar with Saigon.
Maybe I'll recognize this Chow.
Which one of us gets her?
She's mine!
She's responding!
Not the reaction we hoped for!
Are you Cheung Chi-mun?
Hello, Mr. Chow.
Hello.
This is my cousin Mark.
Let's go over there.
Mr. Chrung, you've just gotten out of prison.
You're fast at making connections.
What's your connection with Bong?
Chung introduced me.
Chung?
Yes.
I can tell the soldiers outside
to use you for target practice!
What's the matter?
They're looking for Chow Ying-kit.
These two guys are friends of mine.
Let me talk to them.
It's OK.
Leave!
Does she know us?
This is your territory. Why ask me?
You're looking for Chow Ying-kit?
He's Uncle Ten, the boss here.
I'm Chow Ying-kit.
Bong is a complicated fellow.
He doesn't need you for the black market.
There's lots of other ways to make money.
Why choose this path?
You've been in prison.
If bong cheats you
and you're arrested again,
you'll never see Hong Kong again.
I've done business with Bong twice,
he could have betrayed me long ago.
You say that Bong's complicated.
In this business, aren't we all?
Mr. Cheung, you're an outsider.
We're all Chinese.
A piece of advice for you.
Don't get involved in things
you can't control.
Excuse me.
Miss Chow. Mun!
Miss Chow.
Please don't blame us for our ignorance.
He's an overseas Chinese.
We're doing this for my uncle.
You know now these old Chinese are.
They struggle all their lives to get ahead.
If I can't get them out of here
and they stay, what is it all for?
So I've come back
to take them to Hong Kong.
I don't want to gamble like this.
You've seen this country.
Everyone gambles.
Including this war.
Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring!
Our gambling chips
are being played by others.
We have no control over who wins or loses.
Not even a choice over
whether to play or not.
If this were our own place,
we wouldn't need to leave.
Everyone here tonight is escaping.
To leave or to stay,
it's all a gamble.
You are very capable.
If you don't serve as the casino's banker
we won't even have a chance to gamble.
You said that all of us are Chinese.
Try to see it from our perspective.
Tell us what to do.
Fate is merely a game of gamble.
According to my usual practice,
I never conduct business here.
As to the time and place,
I'll have someone contact you.
What are you doing?
I'll answer the phone.
Don't bother. I'll answer it.
It's just the phone! Why so anxious?
It's Mun's girlfriend.
Asking him to have a last fling.
Then what are you so nervous about?
Me?
Waiting for your girlfriend, too?
Mun and I met that girl at the same time.
So part of the fling should be mine.
I'm going over now for my phone fling.
His Dad and I used to be
just like that, too.
It's hard to escape the tender trap!
What are you laughing at?
You don't even know what I'm talking about!
Eat your dinner!
Let me have the phone!
Come on!
Hello, Miss Chow.
Hello?
Hello...
Why isn't she saying anything?
She's already hung up.
Playing tricks on me!
What's up?
Tonight at 8:30 at the Alhambra Theatre.
Miss Chow, it's getting late.
Still want to wait?
This car's from the Foreign Ministry.
They won't do anything!
Don't try anything!
We've a permit from the Foreign Ministry.
Bong!
Bong!
You haven't stopped the car yet!
Mun!
Why you're so late?
We've been waiting you for long time.
This is Major Hau.
Please excuse us for being late, Miss Chow.
Miss Chow Ying-kit is
the buyer I told you about.
This is my cousin, Mark.
Miss Chow, this is Bong.
Pleased to meet you.
Let me help you with this.
Come on!
Hurry up!
Go where?
Upstairs.
Mark, stay here.
I'll stop Bong from getting away.
Don't go there. It's too dangerous.
The army is on its way up.
Sooner or later
we'll have to make our escape.
Cover me. I'll get the gold back.
No bullets left!
Mun, come on!
Forget about the money.
Let's get out of here.
What about Miss Chow?
Where's Miss Chow?
Over there!
Mark...
Mark, are you ok?
Very proud of yourself, aren't you?
Did you see Bong's expression?
You certainly earned your commission.
Otherwise, why go to so much trouble?
I worship you more than
any other woman on earth!
I thought it was your mother.
Miss Chow.
Let me return this to you.
I hope I didn't get your lipstick dirty.
I forgot all about it!
I'd never thought
you'd take such good care of it!
Old songs always make for
great listening.
Proof that old things
are better than new ones.
Do you agree with me?
How do you know each other?
Uncle Ten, what are you trying to say?
I think you still remember Mr. Ho.
He made you what you are today.
Could you ever forget him?
Ho's disappeared in Holland for 3 years.
I miss him very much.
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't have the success I have today.
You don't have to remind me.
What is Ho's relationship to you?
More than ten years ago,
when Ho was just starting out,
he came into the bar with 2 guns one night.
I was singing in the bar then.
I thought just one man against ten...
I was impulsive and took the stab for him.
I saved his life.
Afterwards, we took on the world.
We were together a long time.
He was not only my lover,
but also my closest.
Now, his enemies are out to kill him,
so he's disappeared for 3 year.
Do you know what it feels like
to lose someone dear?
The dearest person to me is my father.
I don't know what's happened to him.
Nobody knows if he's alive or dead.
All these years, everything I've done...
has been for my uncle and my cousin Mun.
I don't dare have any hopes for myself.
I only know... the bigger the hopes,
the greater the disappointment.
Actually, hopes are just a big gamble.
If you lose, it's very painful.
I'd rather not even try.
When I was poor,
I just wanted to make it big.
Now, I have money, position,
everything but a close friend.
It's hard to make it to the top,
but impossible to go back.
There are many things, I can look back
and observe, but I can't go back.
Since you don't expect too much,
you should be happier than me.
It's been a long time
since I talked so much!
Really?
Stop crying
What's the use of going back?
In 1997 Hong Kong will return to China.
We'll just have to come back here.
Vietnam's been at war for so many years.
The situation here is no worse than before.
Uncle, it's 1974.
25 years until 1997.
That's a long time.
Might as well go back for a look.
Yeah!
Let's go.
It's all a matter of fate.
Everything is pre-ordained.
Mark, the taxi's waiting.
We're carrying so much US dollars,
will Customs give us trouble?
Don't worry. Kit knows those guys.
She'll arrange for us at the airport.
It's been two decades now,
and I have to leave it behind...
Hey, Pat!
Be careful, Pat!
The camera!
Turn off the lights!
I almost forget we're not coming back!
Uncle, let me pack it for you.
This money's for you. Don't waste it.
I'll come back when
the political situation have settled down.
Take good care of yourself.
Don't forget to close the windows at night.
Wipe away the dust when you have time.
It's up to you to take care of
this big place.
On clear days,
take the medicine out to dry.
We're running out of time, Dad. Hurry up.
The taxi meter is running.
Let the medicine get moldy.
Why are you so reluctant to leave this shop?
I'll get you a new one in Hong Kong.
Does he even understand
what you're saying?
He understands more than you.
I looked at that sign
and he knew to take it down.
Why didn't you take it down
So what if he took it down.
Now it's up to me
to get it to the airport.
Let's go! The plane won't wait for us.
Why are you so impatient?
Go by yourself.
I'll tell Pat to hang it back up.
I'm not going!
I went to a lot of trouble
to get your exit permit!
Don't make all of us miss the plane!
If you still have instructions
on the medicine.
You have no sentiment for the past!
Let's go
Ok, I'm going.
I'll go in and get a luggage cart.
Be careful!
This sign is a lot of trouble.
Be careful with that signboard.
Mun! Mun!
Mun!
It's great seeing you!
Mark?
He went over there to look for you.
Kit, we have a lot of US dollars on us.
Will we have any problems?
I'll find a way.
I'm Mun's Dad.
Uncle, I'm Chow Ying-kit.
Miss Chow.
Pleased to meet you.
I'll go look for Mark.
Mun, is she the 'last fling'?
Dad, what do you mean by 'last fling'?
She's going with us.
Don't jinx us by saying unlucky things!
Wait for me here.
Kit!
What's the matter?
There are a lot of new people in Customs.
Don't worry, It'll be ok.
I'll take another look.
Get in line first.
Don't push!
Don't take too long.
Time to board the plane.
Officer, have a drink on me!
Dad!
He has heart trouble. Don't push him.
Dad!
Don't ruin it!
Dad! Uncle!
Hurry! Help him sit down!
Dad, where's your medicine?
Dad!
Uncle, please don't scare me!
Mun, hurry up.
I'm afraid I won't make it.
For sure!
You'll make it to Hong Kong for sure.
For sure!
Dad, I found it.
Take your medicine. Hurry!
You'll be fine once you swallow it.
Dad, how are you?
Dad!
He took our passports!
Take care of him!
Mark!
You asshole!
Don't!
Damn it!
Get it! Don't pretend!
Put down the club!
Get up! Acting like a dog!
Dad, you're all right?
Come on! Anyway, nobody will get away.
We'll all die together. Get up!
Beat me if you dare!
He's... he's repacking the suitcases.
Can we go?
Very soon!
We'll be back in Hong Kong soon.
Kit!
You're ok?
Fine.
Better get on the plane fast!
What about you?
I have to stay behind as a witness.
Uncle!
Go with your mind at ease.
You won't have to be subjected to this anymore.
We accused that Customs officer
of corruption, so I have to stay here
and be a witness in court.
We'll all meet again in Hong Kong.
Take care!
You too.
Hurry up and get on the plane!
HONG KONG
Due to the Watergate incident,
the U. S congress has requested
According to observers, after Nixon resigns
the situation in Vietnam will worsen.
But the South Vietnamese government emphasizes
they have confidence in the current situation
and will continue
their liberal economic policies.
Next Monday, the President of Vietnam
will convene an emergency meeting
to deal fairly and impartially
with the serious problem of corruption.
He pledges to the National Council that
the government will be cleaned up.
Get out of the way!
Reuters reports:
A fierce aerial attack launched by Japan
on South Vietnam last Saturday.
Casualty figures
are still unavailable.
Due to the current instability in Vietnam,
many Vietnamese boat people have arrived
in Hong Kong during the past few days.
The Hong Kong government and the UN
are conducting discussions over ways
to help solve the refugee problem.
I told you they were finished!
It's a good thing we left when we did!
So what? We still lost our home!
Cousin Mark, sorry I got in your way!
I didn't mean to bother you.
Don't blame me!
I shouldn't have gotten mad. Never mind!
You shouldn't miss dinner.
You'll have no energy.
Have some soup.
Thanks.
Vietnam is in chaos.
I wonder how Kit is?
I hope she's ok.
We still haven't had any news about her.
Mark! There's a car outside
with a flat tire.
You want to repair it?
Let me take a look.
Hey, friend! Which tire is flat?
Mun!
Look who's here!
Mun!
Mun!
What's the matter? Can't fix it?
Tell him to leave it here.
Look who's come!
Who?
Kit!
I thought I'd have to
go to Siagon to find you!
Mark and I talk about you all day and night.
I mussed your hair!
Great! The family has been reunited.
Uncle
Dad!
Mun goes to the airport everyday
to wait for you.
Mark, take her things inside.
Uncle, she has her own home.
How can you ask her to move in here?
It'll happen sooner or later.
I'm sorry. My hand's sweating.
How do you know the night club manager?
It seems you know each other very well.
Our company has shares in the this place.
Evergreen invests in everything!
Excuse me, boss.
Sit down! Have a seat!
Don't be bashful. Sit down!
Let me introduce you; my cousin, Mun.
Mark, let's just sit and chat,
no need for so many hostesses.
In this kind of a place, how can
you not have hostesses keep you company?
Kit, you're the boss here,
why so few hostesses to serve us?
You're not a very good friend!
Mr. Cheung, Miss Chow.
Mama-san.
This is Baby.
Baby, take a seat.
He is my cousin.
Hello!
She is Tina.
Tina, hello!
Flora!
Hi, Flora!
Come on. Take a seat!
Drink...
Mark, we're leaving.
Let's go.
Come on!
Boss, tell Mama-san that
I'm very happy tonight.
I want her, and her...
to join me for a late snack.
Thank!
Drink...
Find out what Mr. Cheung desires,
and put it on my company's bill.
Thanks a lot!
You can treat me whenever I come here?
Have a good time. I'm leaving now.
Kit, I'll take you home.
Oh, so Mr. Cheung is a friend of Miss Chow
Miss Chow...
Where's Miss Chow?
In the car.
Where?
Kit!
See what you've done!
Go and talk to her!
Kit...
Kit...
She threw up all over the car.
Go and talk to her.
Kit!
You take her home.
What's the matter?
Why do you want to go off by yourself?
Why can't we three go together?
There are a lot of
things 3 can't do together.
Don't you and Kit involve me in your affairs.
I'm giving you the chance
to take her back home.
You said that whoever she chooses,
there will be no grudges between us.
What do you mean by that?
You're giving me a chance
to be with Kit, right?
Mun, I know how you feel about Kit.
Don't worry. I'll never say you're petty.
Pursue her whole-heartedly.
Don't disappoint Uncle.
Two cousins after the same girl...
but only one can be her bridegroom.
Mark...
Mark...
Kit, I'm Mun. I'm not Mark.
I know. Take me home.
Mr. Cheung. Your car is over there.
Your keys.
I'm not leaving yet.
Everything will work out.
The Yanks and Vietnamese
are having peace talks.
There won't be any more problems.
Miss Chow wanted us
to move back to Hong Kong.
That was an unwise move.
Hong Kong is more peaceful.
So we're refugees now!
Ho Cheung-ching!
Kit, they said you were drunk.
So I didn't wake you up.
I love the way you redecorated my place.
I almost didn't recognize my old office.
Fortunately, you haven't changed.
Just a bit thinner.
You surely have many problems you can't solve.
I've come back to help you.
Uncle! Let me do that!
We're having our grand opening. Happy?
Of course I'm happy.
I've had a lot of time to think
in these 3 years.
All day I'd ask myself...
how could my enemies find out
where I was in Holland?
My betrayer must be a trusted friend.
Grand opening! Here's lucky packet!
Thanks, Uncle.
Uncle Ten, tell everybody
how Cheng knew my every movement.
Mr. Ho, outsiders see how close we are
and try to drive a wedge between us.
If I did such a despicable thing,
would I have the guts to see you?
Don't you worry about your kids...
in the United States?
Tell everyone how there could be
so many killers waiting for me
at that Dutch bank?
How did your Swiss bank account
got an extra 2 million US dollars?
Mr. Ho,
I've let you down. I was wrong.
I won't make it hard on your family.
I'll let you do the honorable thing.
Get out of my way!
I'll shoot anyone who tries something!
Mr. Ho, let me get out of this alive.
Don't force me, Mr. Ho.
You have the guts to betray me,
why not shoot me?
So afraid that you can't shoot?
Shoot
They're blank!
Miss Chow is busy?
This lucky packet is for you.
Mr. Ho, let me go.
I didn't want this to happen.
I was forced into it by that gang! I...
In three years,
I've never killed one of my own.
That's because you never lost anything.
I grew up in the Cambodian war.
I lost far too many things.
So I don't let go of things very easily.
Uncle!
Uncle, are you all right?
Dad!
Uncle!
Uncle!
I'm Ho Cheung-ching.
Maybe you've heard my name.
Both of you are very capable.
Running a garage so soon
after leaving Vietnam!
No matter where you go,
you'll make good.
You two were good companions to
Miss Chow in Vietnam.
Every man has his price.
I'll pay you compensation.
You've been here long enough.
I want you to leave Hong Kong.
You're lucky to leave alive.
Don't come back.
Don't think that just because you left Vietnam
and came here that things would be peaceful.
There's no difference!
You're lucky
the flower basket didn't kill you.
But luck doesn't last forever.
I've said what I wanted to say.
You may leave.
Go to hell!
Mark
You have one bullet, so do I.
See who has the guts to fire.
Not many willing to roll the dice
in this world.
If you can't afford to gamble, don't gamble!
It may not be fair.
Mark, forget about me. Kill the bastard.
Don't act rashly.
You think there's a choice?
No. If there were a choice, millions of
Vietnamese wouldn't be trying to escape.
There wouldn't be so many
beggars on the street.
The world wouldn't have so many
people starving.
People don't have choices.
Don't worry about me.
Don't give up your gun.
Mun!
Dad, I should have let you stay in Vietnam.
We went through so much
to bring you here, what for?
If you'd stayed in Saigon,
you'd still be alive.
Dad!
Kit's come to pay her last respects to Dad.
I'm responsible for his death.
Don't be silly.
You didn't send those flowers.
If it weren't for me,
Uncle wouldn't have died.
You mustn't stay apart because of me.
Kit, there isn't any more time.
They're forcing us to leave Hong Kong.
Will you agree to go away with Mark?
I'll help Mark pack his things.
Tomorrow I'll buy tickets and see you off.
Mun, you have to go, too.
We all leave tomorrow.
Ok. I'll have Ling to start packing.
I brought you a gift from Vietnam.
But I never had the chance to give it to you.
See if you like it.
Thanks!
It's beautiful.
Try it on and see.
No matter what happens tomorrow,
we must treasure the moments
we have together.
Sorry, I lied.
I won't leave with you guys.
A lot of people want revenge on Ho.
You two have no way to deal with Ho.
I can't. If I must perish with him,
so be it.
Let me settle the old scores with him.
Settle them? How can you do that?
The desire to regain control of
his property drives him back to Vietnamese
And I'll go to assist him.
You take care of Mark for me.
But you and Mark mustn't interfere!
What do you plan to do?
I'll take the morning plane with Ho.
I know that Mark won't be able
to forgive me...
If I never make it back alive,
I hope that
you'll explain everything to him.
Tell Mark that I didn't betray him.
I hope he'll understand and not hate me.
It doesn't look like Sagon
will last much longer
So we must get our money out
while there's time.
The situation out there...
reminds me of 1945
The Japanese Army was retreating
from Indochina.
My Dad was a Japanese businessman here.
But he couldn't bear
to leave his property behind
In the end, he was executed
by the guerillas.
I was 6 at the time.
In order to survive,
I assumed a Chinese name ""Ho""
After all these years,
I've almost forgotten
my real name is Tanaka.
Mr. Ho, they're searching
the vehicle ahead of us.
Don't worry.
Phone me as soon as you
and Ling get to Taiwan.
Take care!
Where are you going?
To the airport.
You bought the plane tickets?
Yeah.
What about Kit? You don't wait for her?
We arranged to meet at the airport.
She didn't say she's going to the airport.
We arranged it. She'll be there for sure.
Mark, don't lie.
Kit isn't even in Hong Kong.
Where is she?
She took the morning flight to Vietnam.
He went with Ho.
So there's no need for you
to go looking for Ho.
Pat!
Nobody here!
Pat!
Pat!
Don't shoot!
Mun, Mark.
Don't you recognize us?
Mun, look! He's a soldier!
What did he say!
He want to know about his father
Has he got the letters from him
What did he say?
With the Yanks leaving,
there's an oil shortage.
The phones are out of order, too.
There're so many hotels,
let's spilt up and search for Kit.
Miss Chow, so we meet again!
In this world, those who should die never die!
Why should people like you survive?
Thanks to you, I was jailed for 2 months.
But you won't be so lucky this time.
Lock them up. Deal with them the army way.
So you're Bong? I'm Ho.
Kit's boss.
I'd like to talk business with you.
If we can work together,
I'll give you 3 million US dollars.
We'll both come out ahead.
Ok, but I won't let you leave my side.
No problem.
But I have one condition:
I hear that all flights might stop
at any moment.
You army people have your own methods.
If you can get me some documents,
and use military connections to get us out,
I'll pay you immediately.
You found Miss Chow?
Does Mark know?
Mark hasn't come back yet.
But Miss Chow only wants to see you.
Let's not wait for Mark.
I'll take you over to Miss Chow.
If she leaves,
it'll be impossible to find her again.
We better hurry!
Mark's here, too.
He really wants to see you.
Here are two plane tickets.
Saigon will fall soon.
All flights have stopped.
Only two seats left for the last flight
out tomorrow. You and Mark must go.
We're Hong Kong citizens.
We won't be in any danger.
There's a war going on here.
With a change in government,
anything can happen.
Kit, if it's so serious,
you should come with us.
I still have business to attend to here.
Don't worry. Ho and Bong have an agreement.
We'll get out with the military's help.
No way I can't let you leave us again.
The only reason we came back
was for you.
I want to take you back to see Mark.
Mun, when you're in the midst of a war,
you must put your emotions to aside
and just survive!
I shouldn't have let you come back.
You can't solve all of our problems
by yourself.
I'll tell Pat to bring Mark here.
Wait for him.
I don't have time to wait.
At times like this,
who has the right to make requests?
Nothing is ever really one's own.
The more hopes you have,
the greater the pain.
I can't see him again.
No!
Kit...
Kit...
Mun, are you all right?
Can you move?
Yes.
Rush out.
You two must leave.
Pat!
Behind is a wooden wall.
Mun! Kit!
Quick!
Mun...
Who is it?
Is Mun dead?
Actually, you decided long ago
to return with Ho.
So why did you look us up in Hong Kong?
You knew I came back to Saigon with Mun,
so why did you only want to see him?
You have so many secrets.
What else haven't you told me?
I have nothing to explain.
If you say I'm wrong then I'm wrong.
I've never regretted anything.
You really know how to handle a gun.
You've killed so many people.
Even Mun died at your hand.
Why don't you shoot me, too?
How many will you kill before you're happy?
There's a reason behind our actions.
Who is right, who is wrong,
someday you'll understand.
When Mun came,
he told me over and over that
if you find someone whom you truly love
never give them up, even if it means death.
He said that you'd never betray me.
But now I know what kind of person you are.
Even if you aren't my enemy,
I never want to see you again
as long as I live.
Mark...
Mark.
Mark.
Mun isn't dead! He's over there! Hurry!
Hurry!
Mun!
Mun! Mark!
Mun!
Have you seen Kit?
Where's Kit?
Why isn't she come with you?
Kit?
This the cash left in Vietnam.
It's mine. No matter where I go,
it will always return to my side.
Things that don't belong to you
will never be yours.
Don't move anything!
Mr. Ho, we're both
playing for the same stakes.
I'm in charge here.
You can't fight me
without shattering yourself.
The U.S. Consulate is burning its cash.
They're treating their money like garbage.
But to us, this green paper money
is worth dying for and killing for.
Miss Chow, don't move!
Put your gun down!
At times like this I realize
how much we need each other.
Why did you bring a time bomb?
Mark is in Vietnam.
I know that neither of you
will let the other go.
What is so great about Mark
that you would pay such a price?
When you pay the final price?
You have no time to consider its worth.
No choice, good!
Mark, where are you?
Ho!
Ho!
I'm not Ho!
I share the same name with God!
It exists if I want it to. It's meaningless.
Listen, my real name is Tanaka.
It's better to know the killer's name
before dying, right?
Whoever you are,
You are still responsible for
what you've done!
It's becoming a slaughterhouse out there.
Everyone is after revenge.
Welcome to our vengeful world.
This is a burning hell,
And it will lead you to a dead end!
I know!
The last plane out of Vietnam has left.
It makes no difference if I live or die.
I just want to see
blood debts paid in blood.
You're just a garage mechanic!
Remember, what goes around,
comes around.
You'll get what you deserve!
My gun is already out of bullets.
You have your chance.
Don't shoot!
Kit!
Kit!
After all these years with you,
the my only regret is
shot Miss Chow.
Mr. Ho, when you go to the airport,
the most important thing is to bring the money.
Kit!
Why did you come back?
If I didn't,
I'd regret it the rest of my life.
I've never regretted anything.
Kit...
You mentioned retribution.
But where is it now?
Here is your retribution,
to lose someone you love most.
No matter what, I'm going to get even.
If you shoot, I'll be grateful.
Grateful for bringing Kit and me together.
Bong!
Ho!
I'm going now.
Don't let Kit follow me.
Wait!
Mun!
Mun, get in!
Mun!
Get in fast! Hurry up!
Mun!
Mun How's Kit?
She's seriously injured.
We better get her inside the van.
Pat!
Pat!
Mun, help me carry it.
Mark, hurry up!
Kit, Mark, hurry up!
Mun, go over there!
Mark!
Doctor...
She's critically injured. Please help her.
He said there's not enough plasma here.
He can't even save this child's life.
Don't worry about me.
There's still time for you
to rush to the military airport.
I have a transit pass.
But you must hurry!
The Thai border is near.
There's a Red Cross there
We can still save Kit.
Mark! Go!
Out of the way! Faster!
I have a pass. Let me in!
Mark! The plane!
We're almost there!
The plane is just ahead.
Mark!
Out of the way!
Mark, Mun...
Pat...
Pat...
Don't mind me. Go
I've to find my parents.
Pat, take off uniform
Pat, take care!
Take care!
Kit!
Kit!
Kit!
Kit!

26,A Better Way to Die (2000) - full transcript,"Set along the highways of the U.S. heartland, the story follows the journey of an ex-cop who is inadvertently thrust into a fierce struggle between the FBI and the Chicago underworld, both of which are searching for a missing federal agent who holds the key to the syndicate's demise.","- Is he nervous?
- Yeah, he might be a little nervous.
Big fucking nervous if you ask me.
Nobody's nervous.
If these fucks smell any nerves on you,
they'll know you're a cop.
And if they know you're a cop,
if they even think you're a cop, -
- they'll slit your fucking throat
and drop you in this alley. Permanently.
That dumpster will be your new condo.
Why don't you go
screw yourself, Fletcher?
It's ""fuck yourself""!
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Lose the dress, will you, honey?
Christ.
- Mary Poppins here's too nervous.
- Nobody's nervous.
Lunchtime. Time for lunch.
- What is up with this lunchtime shit?
- Meals are very important to him.
Then why did he toss the last three
all over the alley?
After this, we shoot over to
Mona & Jerry's.
- A little pasta and meat sauce.
- I like meat sauce.
I know.
You guys are sweet.
You're tight.
Hey, college boy. Don't fuck this up,
or you'll get us all killed.
Hey, Carlos?
- I'm nervous.
- I know.
- You good?
- Good enough.
If they start asking
ten thousand questions, what do you say?
If you guys are going to make us take
some SATtest...
Pick it up. You have to come
back at them with brass ball.
What are you doing? Selling spaghetti?
Put your hands down.
If you don't know what to do with
your hands, just scratch your balls.
Nobody will ever look at you and say:
""That guy looks nervous.""
Maybe: ""He's a slob.""
""He's got no class,"" but never:
""That guy looks nervous."" Again.
Don't always look right at the man.
Look around.
Watch the cars go by.
Or watch some dog taking a shit
across the street.
You only look the man in the eye
when you're insulting him.
Again.
This time give me some profanity.
If you jackasses are going to
make us take the goddamn SATs...
...before we do business.
That's good. More profanity.
Shit. Fuck. Motherfucker.
They'll eat that shit up.
Don't forget ""cocksucker"".
It's timeless. Never loses its punch.
Cocksucker.
If you fuckfaces are going to make us
stand in the freezing fucking cold -
- and take the goddamn SATs
before we do business, -
- you can take your shit merchandise
and stick it up your ass.
I suggest you virgins take
your jerk jobs at a tortilla stand -
- and get on back to
Shamburg or Arlington fucking Heights.
Or whatever candy-assed suburb
you bitches took the bus out of.
We're doing you
the motherfucking favour! Remember that.
Cocksucker.
Gee, what a mouth on this guy.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
We thought Rico worked out
all the bullshit with you pap smears.
Yeah, me and Rico did
a little talking today.
- What did he say?
- He said you guys are really tight.
- What else did he say?
- He said you guys are tight and...
What was that other thing he said?
Go get Rico.
We're going to get Rico.
Oh yeah, that's right.
He said you guys are cops.
- You hurt him, you die.
- I want you to see something.
See that? That's what we do to pigs!
Even little piglets like you.
Damn it!
You motherfucker!
Shit...
Come on, you fucking goons!
Boomer... go get that motherfucker!
Fuck!
You have the right to remain silent.
Yadda, yadda, yadda.
Do it, Boomer. I'm your witness.
He went for his gun.
For Carlos, man!
For Carlos.
Get with the programme, kid.
Or get the hell out.
Big Daddy's Diaper Service.
You mess 'em, we press 'em.
- How's my old partner?
- Harrison James.
Rifkin, I'm in a jam and you might be
the only guy I can trust.
Fuck you.
I've completed the file and I'm
turning it over to my bureau contact.
But it may be a double-cross, Rifkin,
and I may need your help.
Fuck you.
Salvy, it's me, Harry.
I'm in a serious mess, Salvy. Pick up.
Please.
Go wait for me.
There's a good chance
I'm walking into a set-up.
If you don't hear
from me by tomorrow, -
- call Flash.
He'll find me.
You said you'd forgive
me when I was ready.
I'm ready.
Looks like it's just you and me, pal.
I want to see him first. Face to face.
I want to see him.
Pick up, Rifkin. I'm going to Canyon.
It's nine thirty. You look like hell.
Nice work.
Coop, this is...
Asshole!
Cheryl... Sharon?
It was Cheryl.
I think that was Cheryl.
The director's in town.
He wants to see you.
- He's here? In Chicago?
- And he wants to see you.
Steer you breath away
from his direction.
You still have that
Bouquet de Bourbon je ne sais quoi.
Nervous?
Wait a second.
Let me get
this thing off.
Fuck it.
Billy, what do you know about
special agent Harrison James?
He was supposed to deliver
some information to us -
- which we were then to relay
to Washington, but he never showed.
Special agent James
has been with the CIB over twelve years.
He has been extremely loyal
and extremely effective.
All contact with him has been
through telecommunications.
His identity has been classified
due to the nature of his assignment.
And the nature is?
Are you familiar with the name
Charles Van Adder.
Yes. Supposedly the head of
an internal spy ring.
A domestic organization, I believe.
We believe he is gathering
classified government information -
- and selling it to the highest bidders.
Special agent Dexter...
I am quite aware that you are
responsible for shutting down -
- two of the biggest crime families
in this city.
Thank you for being so... aware, sir.
Even more impressive is you did so
at such a young age.
However, much less inspiring are
your achievements since your promotion.
You spend more time womanizing than
giving a shit about national security.
- Some would call you a drunk.
- We need you back one hundred per cent.
We need someone who knows the mob.
We're afraid Van Adder has united
the families your team shut down, -
- and nowthey're working against
the government.
Special agent James has compiled
information on one of these.
Identities of Van Adder informants,
which would allow us to shut him down.
Practically overnight.
Why me? Why here in Chicago?
Special agent James was going to
deliver the file to us here in Chicago.
- But he didn't.
- Why not?
We don't know.
- Do we think he's been killed?
- We don't know.
The bureau does not like
not knowing things.
Dead or alive, James is in the area
and Van Adder is on to him.
Find special agent James and his file
before Van Adder does.
You find him before the bureau does.
His woman has hired a detective.
He goes by the name Flash.
See what he knows.
Any problems... deal with them.
Goodbye, Carlos.
I can't make it here without Carlos.
I need you, Kelly. I miss you.
I miss you.
But I don't like what you do, Boomer.
I don't like that city
and I'm never going back there.
I'm leaving Chicago, Kell.
I want to come up there and be with you.
I want to make it work this time.
- I want to make it work
- What are you saying?
I quit the department.
I'm done. For good.
Boomer, are you coming up here
because you hate that city?
- Or because you love me?
- I love you, Kelly.
And I'll prove it to you
if you give me one more chance.
Just listen to me.
Take care of everything
you have to take care of down there.
And then get up here
as fast as you can.
Beautiful night for baseball in Chicago.
One away, bottom half of the fifth.
One-one tie at this point.
Hubert tossing a dandy for Toronto.
Hello? Please stop!
Hubert set. Inside and tie ball one.
He came after him a bit on that one.
Really setting the tone for this at bat.
- What seems to be the problem?
- And it's long! This ball is way back!
And it's out of here!
- Is this an ambush?
- What?
Roll over. On your belly. Let's go.
- It's the ""hurt guy on the road"" trick.
- No, sir. Just a hurt guy on the road.
I invented that trick, son.
If anybody tries to ambush me, -
- your partner here
gets it between the eyes -
- and up the kester!
There's no ambush. It's just me.
- No ambush?
- No, sir.
Well, shit.
- They call me Flash.
- They call you Flash?
- Well, they call me Boomer.
- They call you Boomer?
Boomer.
Flash.
I like my nickname better.
- Did you come up from the city, Boomer?
- Yes, Flash. And I'm never going back.
- Are you the nervous type?
- Nobody's nervous.
Jesus, fuck!
- Breakfast time. Time for breakfast.
- Yes, it is.
I've got cheddar cheese and crackers.
Danishes, doughnuts, croissants.
Beef jerky, turkey jerky, bologna.
Tuna in springwater or olive oil.
- You like protein shakes?
- Yes.
Meals in themselves.
I've got Swiss vanilla, chocolate fudge.
Banana-strawberry
and my favourite orange-pineapple.
- I'll try a chocolate fudge today.
- Fantastic!
Who's your daddy?
What's with the piece?
My line of work requires it
from time to time.
""Flash. Finder of lost shit.""
Say you lost your granddaddy's watch
your daddy gave you five years ago.
I can find her for you.
Or you're looking for some fancy
Chinese pottery you lost in Guatemala.
- I'll find that too. I find lost shit.
- No shit?
- No, lost shit.
- You hunting for something right now?
- Affirmative.
- What?
That's classified, soldier.
- What did those bastards take from you?
- What didn't they take from me?
They got my car, all my bags, my money.
- Nothing that matters.
- Holy cow. Let me see that.
Oh my. You've got yourself an agenda.
A long-term agenda.
- Lucky lady know it's coming?
- It'll come at her like a curve ball.
- Think she'll take a swing at it?
- I wish I knew.
What the fuck are you doing?
I see it.
Watch the road, man.
Worry not, Boomer boy. She'll swing
for the fences and then some.
- Home run?
- Out of the park, happy ending.
You've got good energy, boy.
Things are going to go your way.
Don't worry.
I'm going to stake you to a bus ticket.
- We've got to get you to this girl.
- You're all right, Flash.
Hey, Flash, is there any special reason
you're driving...
...400 miles an hour?
Affirmative.
It's recently come to my attention -
- a carload of fellers
has been trailing me.
Fellers. Professionals. Assassins.
- It's hard to tell.
- Assassins?
You know what?
You can just let me out up here.
Look, drop me off. Pull over.
No stopping until the next town.
You wait until the next town,
or you can jump out right now.
Give me the phone.
- Where? What?
- Press the green button.
Green button.
Hello?
Flash?
He's got his hand full at the moment.
You've got the wrong guy, lady.
My name isn't Harry.
- Just put the speakerphone...
- One second.
Put it down there.
Just put it back in the cylinder.
No, English, sweetheart.
Whoever answered sounds like Harry.
I thought maybe you found him.
- Not yet, Mrs Jellybellvetus.
- Gelefaveta.
Where are you?
Right now I'm hauling ass,
heading north going up to Middletown.
Did you check that number in Chicago?
Yes. Some jerk named Rifkin
kept hanging up on me.
If you think my co-pilot
sounds like Harry, -
- maybe we ought to get him
to give Mr Rifkin a call.
Nowthat's an ambush.
Who's number one?
That has got to hurt.
You knowthe best way to make
that pain go away from your head?
You re-diffuse the pain.
I'll bet you forgot all about
that little pain in your head.
- What do you know about Harrison James?
- I don't know jack.
No one's asking about Jack.
What do you know about Harry?
Now what do you know?
What the fuck are you doing?
Mr Van Adder likes them
to sweat it out a bit.
I work for him and you work for me.
Hence, by transit of fucking property,
you do what the fuck he says.
Shit isn't professional, man.
That's the shit that's floating in
your bowl, so live with it, Cleveland.
Why don't you and your cousin do
what I'm paying you to do?
Cleveland, why don't we tell this guy
to fuck off?
We can go back down south tonight.
Lou...
I would love to get laid tonight
by my wife in my bed.
But we need this job. We need the dough.
Zoe and Cassandra need the dough.
Carpe per diem.
- Seize the cash.
- Fuck that.
We're not going to fuck that!
You hear me?
Until one of us wins the fucking lotto,
we'll deal with these white fucks.
Shoot this piece of shit. I'm jammed.
Fuck that! I don't have time
to shoot everybody, -
- just because this white douche bag
says we should. It'll fuck up my karma.
You waste him.
Merry fucking Christmas, asshole.
We do this job, we get the cash.
We head back down south.
Together.
Peace, brother.
Peace.
- Do I know you?
- Do I know you?
You know something about this?
You know something about
who killed Flash?
Yeah. It wasn't me.
- You're the one with the voice, right?
- What are you talking about?
Who the fuck are you?
Why are you driving this truck?
I traded it for my Volvo. It's faster.
- Stop the truck. I want out.
- Sorry, no can do.
- No slowing down.
- I'm serious. I want out.
You can wait until the next town
or jump out now.
But I'm not slowing down.
I was just saying that I'm in trouble
and I needed some help.
And I was ready to offer to untie you, -
- treat you to a nice dinner and buy you
a bus ticket to anywhere you want to go.
If you would be willing to make
one simple phone call for me.
I'll throw in 300 bucks.
- Give me the number.
- Okay, here it is.
If he buys you as Harry,
ask him where he thinks you are.
Where I am?
- Where Harry is. You have to be smart.
- I'll be clever.
Big Daddy's Diaper Service.
You mess 'em, we press 'em.
How are you doing there?
I need to speak with Rifkin.
- Harry James, you sockcucker.
- That's right. It's me, Harry.
Still alive.
You didn't sound too good on those
messages. I was hoping you were dead.
Harry James is on the line
with Yanosh Rifkin.
- Now?
- Yeah, we have an exact location.
- If we had that line monitored...
- Then Van Adder did too.
We need to get together.
Set up a meeting.
I like meetings.
I can't tell you exactly where I am
because we might have eavesdroppers.
Get to Chicago by Sunday.
Esquire Lounge.
Tarbender will tell you what to do.
- He's gone.
- What happened?
You got yourself a date in Chicago
on Sunday at the Esquire Lounge.
- Good. But you must come with me.
- I'll meet you down there.
- Goodbye and good luck.
- No, you're coming with me.
- How are you doing, Harry?
- Who are you?
I'm the president of
the Middletown welcoming committee.
- And that's the vice-president.
- Fantastic.
Welcome to Middletown, dickhead.
One simple, easy phone call?
The word was you were tough, Harry.
I'll break you in two so fast.
I'm not Harry James.
Would you tell him this?
He's not Harry James.
He's not even half the man Harry is.
He's a nobody. A loser.
They get your point.
Tell the boys we've got him
up at Novelli's hardware.
Go get the truck now!
That's Harry James?
Do not kill him!
Goddamn, Lou.
Baby, get up.
Don't kill him.
Stop!
I said, don't kill him.
Nice job.
Just chill out.
- We need the file.
- Fuck the file.
That's sweet Lou
laying dead back there.
Contact every Van Adder affiliate
and give them a full description of him.
If we don't have him by morning,
you'll be in a lot of pain, understand?
Sure, no problem.
That's nice. Do they make those for men?
You want your clock stopped, boy?
Or do you just want it cleaned?
He should have been dead yesterday.
I didn't know he was Harrison James.
Besides, today you said, don't kill him.
Just one time,
surprise me and do what I say.
I'm going to kill that boy.
As God is my judge, -
- I'm going to take him down.
Stop the truck.
- Why?
- Stop the truck.
- I'm getting out. I've had enough.
- No, you're not.
Oh yes, I am. See you.
You can't do that.
Get out of my face.
Please help me find Harry. I'll pay you.
- You already paid me.
- I'll pay you again.
Look, Miss Yelisavey...
- I'll call you Salvy. Hows that?
- That's what Harry used to call me.
Really? That's very touching.
Why do you need to find Harry so badly?
He sounds like a real pain in the ass.
- Why don't you dump the bastard?
- I already did. I divorced him.
What, now you want him back?
No. He was in trouble
and he turned to me.
Now I have to find him, but I'm alone
and this may be a bit over my head.
I'll say.
You know, I made a phone call.
One simple, easy phone call.
Five minutes later I've got blood
all over my nice new shirt.
Shoot that through the wash.
Give it to Harry
when you find the bastard.
We are not hauling that thing with us.
He's got a wife waiting for him
down south. That's where I'll bury him.
Yeah, but he's going to stink up my van.
Don't you fuck with me.
Not now.
Your car died? No, don't take a bus.
Don't hitch-hike. Just sit tight.
I can be there by morning.
Just sit back, relax, have a beer.
You got it. I'm in room number five.
- Sweet dreams.
- Bye-bye.
Hey, baby.
Are you going to stand here all night
and sniff that flower?
- Or come and say hi?
- Hi, sleepyhead.
- Long drive?
- Yeah, but well worth it.
You made good time, girl.
What did you average?
300 miles an hour?
- 400.
- That's pretty fast.
- Good-Iooking guy.
- Mr Yanosh Rifkin.
Aka the sexiest man
in the Chicago underworld.
This is James' former partner.
We can monitor Rifkin's line
and pinpoint anyone who contacts him.
The problem is
Rifkin's a telecommunications expert.
We don't know where the hell he is
as he is a telecommunications expert.
The best there is.
Can we do a little something about ...?
So, was special agent James
still working with Cary Grant here?
No chance.
James reported Rifkin for dealing drugs
and weapons to the Chicago underworld, -
- which is now where he hides somewhere.
B plus, Coop.
And we knowthey've planned
a Chicago rendezvous for next Sunday.
A minus.
I wish I could wake up
every morning like this.
You will.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
- Is that right?
- That's right.
- Is that so?
- That's so.
Big day. Get up.
I don't want to. Not yet.
Big day. I want to hit the road.
- I'll drive until St Albans.
- St Albans?
- What happens in St Albans?
- I'll tell you.
They've got this little vineyard
about 20 miles north of here.
They've got a little caf?.
They have little picnics
down by the pond.
- Ducks shooting around left and right.
- You like ducks, huh?
I talked to the guy at the front desk.
He said they do some good chow.
We'll have a nice lunch.
So nice we're going to call it brunch.
- Brunch, huh?
- That's right.
With a nice bottle of wine.
- What's the occasion?
- Big surprise.
What?
I can't tell you what,
or it won't be a surprise, dummy.
- Coffee might get me out of bed.
- Then I will go snag you some coffee.
Then we'll hit the road.
- Why are you wearing my shirt?
- I like this flower-power action.
It takes the edge off my
overbearing masculinity.
- Where's your shirt?
- I don't know.
Here it is.
Why is there blood
all over your shirt, Boomer?
Yeah, why is there blood on your shirt?
I told you, I bumped my head.
Boomer, I don't like it
when you lie to me.
Especially when it involves
bloody T-shirts.
How did you get the cut
on your head, Boomer?
What happened to your car?
Don't tell me you'll leave all that shit
when you've only hauled it with you!
- Nobody's taking anything with them.
- You're going to end up the dead one.
- You'll end up like Carlos.
- Nobody will end up like Carlos.
- I'm sick of this shit!
- I'm sick of it too.
- Bullshit, Boomer!
- Nobody's bullshitting you!
- What did you bump your head on?
- I bumped it on a guy.
A guy?
You know, a headbutt.
Look, Kell. Some other things happened
over the last day -
- that had nothing to do
with me being a cop. Nothing.
You remember when you sent this to me?
Two years ago.
And every day for two years
I've carried this with me in my pocket.
Every day during that awful job
in that awful city.
This is what I want, Kell.
But I don't want any of it
if I'm not with you.
I love you, Kell.
And I'll do anything for you.
- Anything?
- Anything.
Take me to brunch.
And take that off, okay?
Why don't you get dressed and ready,
and I'll go snag you that cup of coffee.
And then we'll go to brunch.
That's right.
Ten minutes is all I can give you, boss.
- How are we doing this morning?
- I hate this fucking job.
Surprise, surprise, motherfucker!
Fuck!
Fuck.
What the fuck ...?
What the fuck are you looking at?
Listen to me.
My name isn't Harry,
and I'm not who you're looking for.
You're exactly who I'm looking for,
motherfucker. You're a dead man.
Oh yeah?
Go ahead, motherfucker. Make my day.
You can't stop me, motherfucker!
Merry fucking Christmas, asshole.
We're even.
Don't move, bastard.
Come on!
Bathroom's clear.
Looks like we've got a manhunt.
Hold your fire!
Get the hell off my property!
- I said, get the fuck off my property.
- Put the gun down now!
- Get out!
- Set it down now or we're both dead!
- Get out!
- Don't fire!
So long, Harry Jim.
You satisfied?
That guy had a chance to kill me
and he didn't.
You killed his girl, didn't you?
Why?
Why not?
What goes around comes around.
I knowthat for a fact.
On many occasions I've been the cat
to make the shit come around.
- What's the word, Coop?
- It wasn't Harrison James.
The report says that the dental work
belongs to a 45-year-old tobacco chewer.
Deputy Warner, did you actually...
Sheriff Warner, did you see agent James?
First of all, who did we torch?
You brain surgeons can figure that out.
Where is special agent James now?
If he's still in Kurker County,
we'll find him.
Do me a favour, would you, Reg?
This time try not to light him on fire.
I currently have two unidentified bodies
at the food mart.
A dead sheriff and a young lady.
And your man is responsible.
- We're talking about a federal agent.
- I don't care if he's an astronaut.
Come shit or Shinola, if we find him,
we just might torch the bastard again.
Can we talk somewhere?
Don't you ever give me one of your
Captain Kangaroo speeches again.
Don't get righteous because you have
two dead bodies in your backyard.
Some civilians got killed, yes.
That's the little picture.
The big picture is called
national fucking security.
- Can you say that?
- National fucking security.
That's right.
Look, if special agent James
is in this area, we must find him.
Says here there was quite
a shoot-'em-up over in Pine Cove.
Says a sheriff was killed.
Also says here a pretty young lady
got shot up pretty badly.
Six, seven times.
You know anything about that?
You had something to do with this?
I'm innocent.
Well, it isn't my job to judge you.
But you've got to clear out of here
tomorrow morning first thing.
Deputy Ray Warner, please.
It was in your pants pocket.
I know.
Now, you've got some bread,
you've got some clean clothes.
Would you like to take this along
for guidance?
I'll feel better if you take this along.
For guidance.
- Go! Go!
- Bedroom's clear.
- Clear out here too.
- Shit.
Okay, bring her here.
Make double sure you've got no shadows.
Nobody shadows Tex.
All right, looks like me and you
are going for a little ride, sweet tits.
Who the fuck are you?
I said, who the fuck are you?
I'm Harry James.
That's him, right there.
Harry Jim.
Is it really you, Harry?
I'm afraid so.
Bullshit.
I don't know who you are, man,
but you're not Harry Jim.
Us blind fothermuckers
have bullshit radar built in.
- I need some information from you.
- You do?
You give me one reason
why I shouldn't blow your head off.
Sockcucker.
- Tex, please tell me you frisked him.
- I took a gun off him.
Now you give me one good reason
why I shouldn't blow your head off.
Cocksucker.
Whatever you're reaching for
had better be a sandwich.
Because you're going to eat it.
What do you know about Harry Jim,
you little fat fuck?
- He left messages. I have the tapes.
- Then play them.
Rifkin, pick up.
Rifkin... I'm bad, man.
They got me bad.
I'm going to... Canyon.
The old rendezvous.
I've got it on me.
What the fuck?
Look way south...
Then go west, past Joliette.
See it?
Yeah, I see it.
Why haven't you sent someone out there?
I don't give a shit anymore.
We've got company.
Bring it on, sockcuckers.
CIB, the building's surrounded.
We're not here to fight.
- We're here to help.
- Fuck you.
Killing a sheriff is a serious crime.
I could turn it into a parking ticket.
I need to know
what you learned from Rifkin.
I need to find special agent James,
and I need your help.
I really don't feel like
helping anybody right now.
I know what happened up in Pine Cove.
I know what happened to your friend
in that hotel room. I'm sorry, kid.
Really, I am.
I've had two wives.
I lost them both because of this job.
One left me,
the other one was taken away.
When this is all over, we can play
Spanish violins for each other, -
- but until then,
why don't you do something about it?
I'm betting Van Adder's
following me right now.
I'll help you find Harry, -
- but if you and your boys tag along,
he's never going to show his face.
But if you stay back in the shadows, -
- he just might move in for the kill,
letting us snag Harry, the file -
- and Van Adder.
I'm sorry for what I said about Harry.
Calling him a bastard.
Don't worry, he was.
He was a bastard.
Any other man could go to hell,
but he's the father of my son.
For that, he gets a second chance.
If he's still alive.
Life's a bitch, isn't it?
- Look who's not dead yet.
- I'd kill him right now.
Before you kill anyone, you should know
you're surrounded by federal agents.
Yeah, right.
Yes?
Just what I wanted to hear.
I'm sorry.
- Laslov, did you find the file?
- The case is right there.
Miles? Where is the file?
- We haven't touched a thing.
- Make sure it's not on him.
- Great.
- Maybe it wasn't in the case.
No, Laslov! He had it in his case
when he met me at the rock quarry.
What did you do with it?
You were in here long enough
to do something with it. Where is it?
- It's nowhere on him.
- Start talking.
Get this thing out of here.
What do you know, Boomer?
What did you do with the file?
Just start talking, please.
I didn't touch anything.
Now you can keep screaming
or start talking. The choice is yours.
Regular or unleaded?
It'll make this nice and tender.
I'm a great chef, did I tell you that?
I love to barbecue.
The man doesn't have a goddamn thing!
Look, Mr Dexter or Van Adder.
If this kid had your file,
he would have coughed it up already.
It's just some sorry cat we got mixed up
with that dead motherfucker.
If you torture him any more, -
- it isn't professional.
It's psychotic. So please...
I should never have hired that homo.
Who was that?
Extra gun I hired.
His name is Cleveland.
Was Cleveland.
It's been a real circus ride, huh, kid?
Speaking of fun rides,
your little girl was a wild tiger.
But I turned her into a little pussycat.
Boomer!
Shit!
Everybody out!
I've never been
much of a computer guy, -
- but I have something you need.
Give me back the file
and you and her will be just fine.
Just tell me where and when.
Surprise, surprise, motherfucker.
You weren't planning on taking my ride,
were you? Because sweet Lou and me...
...we're taking this truck.
- When's it all going to end?
- When you all smell as bad as Lou.
- Put your gun down.
- You first.
- ""Can't we all just get along?""
- I'm afraid not.
In that truck I could make it to
the southern border by sunset tomorrow.
That's with a pit stop
at a fucking hospital.
Too bad I'm taking this truck.
Save your ass, man.
Run. Forget the girl.
- Forget Vanada.
- I won't forget a goddamn thing.
I never touched your girl.
That was wrong.
Yeah, that was wrong.
So was what happened to my cousin.
That was wrong.
Your cousin was trying to kill me.
He wasn't lying half-naked
in a hotel room sleeping.
What the fuck is that?
It's peace, brother. Peace.
How about forgive and try to forget?
And share the fucking truck.
You're going to get yourself waxed
trying to kill Van Adder.
Okay.
Take this.
What, are you nervous?
Nobody's nervous.
You brought the file?
Okay? Let's have it.
There's your file, asshole.
Now are you ready to die?
Am I ready to die?
I could raise my hand right now,
snap my fingers, and you'd drop dead.
Dead as if by the power of God.
That's how much power I have.
Who's number one?
I'm not at the top of this.
This is much bigger
than you can understand.
You kill me,
you bought your death ticket.
Wherever you go, -
- wherever you are, -
- you'll be on the run forever.
Is that really how you want to live?
I can't think of a better way.
What the hell are you doing?"
27,A Big Love Story (2012) - full transcript,"With his glory days long gone, former prominent college football player Sam, after his beloved mother's death of a heart attack and an unfortunate career-ending knee injury, he gradually lets himself swell out to a dangerous weight. Moreover, now that funny and sarcastic, yet insecure Sam is trying to make ends meet as a bowling alley attendant, his love life is practically nonexistent, however, in one of those spur-of-the-moment decisions, he will make a bet with his close friends and visit the nearest gym for the ultimate makeover. Soon, like a fish out of water, Sam will meet with his uncommon personal trainer Cassie, a witty bookworm and a heavy smoker, and straight away, a timid friendship will develop. But does charming Cassie know that she is the girl of his dreams? After all, underneath this overweight teddy bear lies something more than a humble and truthful admirer. There, hides her soulmate.","-THEY NEED TO GET TO THE 46

-OH, DAMN IT!
FUCK!
-YOU OKAY?
-I'M GOING ON A DIET.
THIS IS IT.
YOU SOUND LIKE LaSHAWNA
ON HER PERIOD.

NEVER POINT IT OUT --

-I'M TIRED OF BEING FAT, MILES.

ALBEIT JUST IN A MAGAZINE.

-BUT WHEN?
KEATS WAS PUBLISHED
AND DEAD BY 25.
-ALL RIGHT, WELL,
MAYBE YOU NEED TO SIMPLIFY
YOUR WORK A BIT, YOU KNOW,
MAKE IT MORE CONSUMABLE
FOR THE MASSES?
-MY EXPERIENCE WITH ALGEBRAIC
LITERATURE IS A PRIMAL NEED.
I HAVE TO EXPAND AND INTENSIFY
SOCIETY'S EXISTING WORD SCAPE.
IF I MADE MY WORK
MORE ACCESSIBLE,
THAT WOULD FEEL LIKE --
LIKE A CHICANERY.
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO GO BOWLING?
-WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.
-WE'RE HERE FOR MY MOM...
AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND.
AAAGH.
THIS IS SUCH
THE FAT MAN'S SPORT.

HMM?
I'LL GET YOU A SPIT BUCKET
IF YOU JUST WANT A TASTE.
-NO, THANK YOU.
-WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
-SAMMY HERE IS ON A MISSION
TO LOSE WEIGHT.
-GOOD FOR YOU, SAM. I SHOULD
REALLY LOSE SOME WEIGHT MYSELF.
-WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
-I'M A TRAINER.
I HAVE TO HAVE A SICK BODY.
AND I ALWAYS FEEL FAT
WHEN I'M NEXT TO TYSON.
-YOU DO HAVE A SICK BODY.
-I GET THAT, THOUGH.
THAT'S WHY I'M WITH THIS ONE

SO WHENEVER I FEEL FAT
I LOOK AT HIM,

-WOW, THANKS.
WHENEVER I'M FEELING FAT,
I JUST LOOK AT HIM
AND I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.
-SHUT UP.
-YOU KNOW, SAM, IF YOU
REALLY ARE SERIOUS
ABOUT LOSING WEIGHT,
YOU SHOULD COME TO FAT CUTTERS.
WE'RE SMALL, BUT WE'RE GOOD,
AND I CAN GET YOU A DISCOUNT.
-LOOK, SAM, I LOVE YOU, BUD,
BUT THIS LOSING-WEIGHT THING,
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT GOING TO HIT
DOUBLE DIGITS WITH YOU.

A DAY, A WEEK, A MONTH,
A YEAR -- YOU NAME IT.
-REALLY? WHY DON'T YOU PUT SOME
MONEY WHERE YOUR FAT MOUTH IS?
-NAME THE AMOUNT.

-SEVEN DAYS.
-A MONTH.

HI, MEATBALL.
HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?
YOU'RE ON A DIET, TOO.
IT'S FOR THE BEST.
THERE YOU GO, MAMA.
-OKAY, LAST SIGNATURE.
-IT'S LIKE I'M BUYING A HOUSE.
-CONGRATULATIONS!
YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE FIRST
STEP TO THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
GO GET CHANGED, AND I'LL LET
CASSIE KNOW YOU'RE HERE.
-OKAY. CASSIE?!
A GIRL TRAINER?
YOU WON'T GET JEALOUS?
I'LL TRY NOT TO.
-IS THAT HER OVER THERE?
-NO, THAT'S MELISSA.
CASSIE, LET'S SEE,
SHE'S OVER THERE...
READING A BOOK.
-OH, YEAH, SHE'S CUTE.
IS SHE SMOKING?
-IS SHE? OH!
THIS IS LIKE THE FIFTH TIME
SHE'S DONE THIS.
WELL, YOU GO CHANGE
WHILE I GO TELL SOMEONE
ABOUT THE SMOKING AREA
OUTSIDE -- AGAIN.
-THANKS, GINGER.
HI.
-HI.
-I'M SAM.
I BELIEVE YOU'LL
BE COACHING ME TODAY.
-OH, HEY, I'M CASSIE.
I'M YOUR TRAINER.
HAVEN'T WE MET BEFORE?
-YEAH. I WORK
AT THE BOWLING ALLEY.
YOU CAME IN THE OTHER DAY.
-OH, RIGHT.
SORRY, DO YOU MIND
IF I FINISH THIS?
-NO, THAT'S COOL.
-SO, SAM, HAVE YOU EVER
WORKED OUT IN A GYM BEFORE?
- ALTHOUGH IT
MAY NOT LOOK LIKE IT,
I'VE ACTUALLY SPENT
HALF MY LIFE IN THE GYMS.
I USED TO PLAY FOOTBALL.
-HIGH SCHOOL?
-COLLEGE.
-MY DAD PLAYED FOOTBALL.
-OH, REALLY? COLLEGE, OR...?
-PROFESSIONAL.
-SWEET.
WHAT TEAM DID HE PLAY FOR?
-UM...
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU
EATING A CANDY BAR?
-ENERGY BAR.
IT'S COVERED IN CHOCOLATE.
-YEAH.
- OKAY.
UM, ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LET'S NOT DO THAT,
YOU KNOW, EVER AGAIN,
ESPECIALLY NOT TWO MINUTES
BEFORE WE WORK OUT, OKAY?
-BUT I USED TO ALWAYS EAT
BEFORE PRACTICE.
-YEAH.
-WHAT TEAM DID
YOUR DAD PLAY FOR?
-IT DOESN'T MATTER.
-WHY NOT?
-BECAUSE WE'RE ABOUT
TO GO WORK OUT.
COME ON, HOP UP HERE.
ANY PAST INJURIES?
OH, YEAH, THREW OUT MY ACL.
BROKEN ARM, BROKEN FOOT, TOO
MANY SPRAINS TO EVEN TALK ABOUT,
BUT IT WAS THE ACL
THAT SENT ME HOME.
-AND YOU HAVEN'T
WORKED OUT SINCE?
-NOPE, NOT LIKE
IN SIX OR SEVEN YEARS.
-OKAY, IS THERE ANY PAIN LEFT?
-MOSTLY EMOTIONAL.
PERFECT.
-JUST WANT TO WARN YOU, THOUGH,
I HAVEN'T REALLY RUN
IN A WHILE, SO...
NOT REALLY SURE
HOW THIS IS GONNA GO.
-OKAY, WELL,
WE'LL START YOU OFF WITH A WALK.
-OKAY. THANKS, COACH.
-DON'T CALL ME COACH.
-IT'S NOT SO BAD.
-KIND OF NICE, ACTUALLY.
-HOW'S IT GOING?
-AH, OH! UGH!
THAT ENERGY BAR WAS A BAD IDEA.
-YES, IT WAS.
OKAY, LET'S WORK OUT.
HERE YOU GO.
-WHAT ABOUT THE REAL WEIGHTS?
-WE'LL GET TO THEM SOON ENOUGH.
THESE ARE MUCH BETTER
FOR YOUR CORE ANYWAY.
-THEY JUST LOOK SO WIMPY.
-OH, SWEET JESUS!
OH!
-COME ON, FOOTBALL PLAYER.
YOU'VE GOT THREE MORE...
-OH!
-TWO MORE...
-OH!
OH!
-ONE MORE.
GOOD.
NOW GIVE ME 10 MORE.
OH, YOU'RE KILLING ME.
-THAT'S RIGHT, AND YOU
WILL BE REBORN
FASTER, STRONGER, AND LIGHTER.
GOOD.
THREE...
TWO...
ONE.
-PERFECT.
-I'M GONNA EAT YOUR BABIES.
-THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE IDEA.
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO EAT RED MEAT.
COME ON, FOOTBALL PLAYER.
YOU'VE GOT IT.
-YOU OKAY?
JUST NOT SURE I'M READY
FOR ALL THIS.
-YOUR BODY JUST NEEDS
TO GET USED TO IT AGAIN.
I'M SURE YOU'VE HAD MUCH HARDER
WORKOUTS THAN THIS BEFORE.
-YEAH, I HAVE, BUT...
...I THINK
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.
-ARE YOU SURE?
OKAY.
-STUPID.
WHAT ARE YOU READING?
-A BOOK.
-SO, I WAS GIVING IT
SOME THOUGHT AND...
SO, I WAS THINKING MAYBE
I SHOULD TRY THIS AGAIN.
-SURE. YOU PAID FOR THE MONTH,
SO GO AHEAD AND SIGN IN.
-COOL.
SO, ARE YOU GONNA COACH ME?
-I'M A TRAINER, NOT A COACH.
-TRAINER.
ARE YOU GONNA TRAIN ME?
-THAT DEPENDS.
ARE YOU GONNA QUIT AGAIN?
-I'LL TRY NOT TO.
-ARE YOU GONNA QUIT AGAIN?
-NO.
-OKAY. GO AHEAD AND GET CHANGED.
I'LL MEET YOU OVER
BY THE TREADMILLS.
OH, AND IF YOU'RE STILL HERE
NEXT WEEK, WE CAN GO OUTSIDE.
-WHY?
CAN YOU GIVE ME A JOG?
AW, COME ON, I THOUGHT YOU
USED TO BE A FOOTBALL PLAYER.
IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?
-THAT'S WHY THIS
IS ALL I'VE GOT.
AH, LOOK AT THAT.
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU SMILE.
MAKES YOU LOOK LESS MEAN.
-OKAY, FOOTBALL PLAYER,
KEEP ON JOGGING.
OR WALKING,
SINCE APPARENTLY
THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO.
-WOW, YOU ARE BOUND
AND DETERMINED
TO DEMASCULINE ME WITH THESE
GIRLIE WEIGHTS, AREN'T YOU?
-HAVE FAITH IN THE SMALL THINGS.
IN THEM, YOUR STRENGTH LIES.
ARE YOU REFERRING TO MY...
-NO. MOTHER TERESA.
-HOW'D YOU KNOW
THAT'S WHAT I NAMED HIM?
-OKAY, THERE'S NO NEED TO GO
THERE WITH MOTHER TERESA.
LET'S TRY HOLDING THE WEIGHTS
OUT PERPENDICULAR NOW.
OKAY, AND WE'RE GONNA DO
SMALL ARM ROLLS.
THERE YOU GO.
-ARE YOU A CATHOLIC?
NO, BUT YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE A CATHOLIC
TO APPRECIATE A GOOD
MOTHER TERESA QUOTE.
-ONLY QUOTE I KNOW IS,
""WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU
MAKES YOU STRONGER.""
COACH GRONSKI SAID THAT.
COACH GRONSKI
IS NO MOTHER TERESA.
NOT AT ALL.
-OKAY, FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE
SAID THAT.
-WHAT'S THAT?
-FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE,
THE PHILOSOPHER.
IT'S FROM HIS BOOK ""HOW ONE
BECOMES FROM WHAT ONE IS"".
-SOUNDS LIKE HE STOLE THAT QUOTE
FROM COACH GRONSKI.
-NOT LIKELY.
OKAY, LET'S HOLD THE ARMS OUT
STRAIGHT IN FRONT.
AND WE'RE GONNA COUNT DOWN
FROM 10.
10...
NINE...
EIGHT...
-UGH, YOU'RE LIKE WIKIPEDIA.
-I LIKE TO READ.
SIX...
FIVE...
FOUR...
-YOU KNOW, I'VE ONLY READ ONE
BOOK THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH.
-TWO...
VERY SURPRISING. ONE.
OKAY, RELAX.
WHAT BOOK DID YOU READ?
-""JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH.""
I WAS IN THE SIXTH GRADE.
IT MADE ME REALLY LOVE
PEACHES...
AND WHIPPED CREAM --
MAINLY WHIPPED CREAM.
-YEAH, I CAN IMAGINE.
IT'S A GOOD BOOK.
-YOU'VE READ IT?
-A COUPLE TIMES.
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET BACK UP THERE,
AND THIS TIME DO --
LET'S JUST HOLD THE WEIGHTS UP
30 DEGREES HIGHER.
SO, DID YOU FINISH COLLEGE?
-NO.
WHAT COLLEGE DID YOU ATTEND?
-I DIDN'T.
I MEAN, WELL, NOT YET.
I'M SAVING UP NOW.
-REALLY? I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN DONE BY NOW.
YOU SEEM SO SMART.
-OH, YEAH, HOW SMART AM I?
I'M STANDING OUT HERE
WITH A GIANT MAN,
HELPING HIM HOLD UP
TINY, TINY WEIGHTS.
-SMART.
-AND I SMOKE.
-THAT'S PRETTY DUMB.
-YEAH.
I GUESS ""DUMB"" IS
A GOOD WORD FOR IT.
-YEAH, THE DUMB
LEADING THE DUMB.
-IT'S THE BLIND
LEADING THE BLIND.
-WHO SAID THAT?
-THE THREE MICE.
-OKAY, STOP NOW.
-WE'RE GONNA DO -- CALL TWO.
OOH, I LIKE THAT.
-THERE HE IS!
-WHAT'S UP, GUYS?
-WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
BUT I STOLE YOUR SEAT.
-NAH, IT'S COOL. WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS PLAYING -- STRIP POKER?
-NO.
-WHERE'S GINGER AT?
-SHE'S IN THE BATHROOM
TAKING A SHIT.
WHY DON'T YOU PULL UP
A CHAIR AND JOIN US?
I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOUR MONEY.
-NAH, I'VE GOT A NEW BOOK.
I'M GONNA GO READ.
YOU GUYS HAVE FUN, THOUGH.
-IT'S NOT A BOOK.
IT'S A FUCKING CHOCOLATE BAR.
AH, SAM'S NOT THE ONLY ONE
HAVING A GOOD WORKOUT, HUH?
BOTH OF US.
-THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
TO WIN THIS WEIGHT WAR,
I'M GONNA BE GOING SOLO.
I'M NOT HELPING YOU WIN
THIS THING.
ARE YOU MAD?
-NO. OKAY?
I JUST -- I JUST HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.
-OKAY, WHAT?
-I'M PREGNANT.
-WHAT?
-I'M PREGNANT.
-BULLSHIT.
-NO, I AM.
I AM PREGNANT, MILES.
-NO, NO, NO.
MILES.
-WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW?
-BECAUSE I'M FATIGUED.
-SO AM I.
-OKAY, MY BREASTS ARE TENDER.
-THEY SHOULD BE.
-REALLY? NO.
I GET SICK IN THE MORNING,
MILES.
SO...I'M PREGNANT.
WELL...
-UH-HUH.
-ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?
-YEAH, I MEAN, YOU'LL DEFINITELY
LOSE THE WEIGHT WAR.
WHAT?!
-PUTS ME FURTHER FORWARD.
-ARE YOU SERIOUS, MILES?
YOU REALLY DON'T GET THIS,
DO YOU?
-YOU'RE PREGNANT.
-WE'RE PREGNANT.
-WE'RE PREGNANT.
-WE'RE PREGNANT!
OH, BOY!
-OR GIRL!
-I'M JUST SO ANNOYED BECAUSE
HE BREAKS UP WITH ME
AND THEN PROCEEDS TO --
AND GET THIS --
INVITE ME TO HIS POETRY READING.
-I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW PEOPLE
DID POETRY READINGS.
-YEAH, WELL, HE'S KIND OF
A DORK, BUT...
THAT'S WHY I LOVE HIM.
-YOU SHOULD JUST SHOW UP
TO THE READING WITH
SOME OTHER GUY.
-WHAT? I CAN'T DO THAT.
BESIDES, WHAT KIND OF GUY
WOULD I EVEN TAKE?
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE
A BIG MEATHEAD LIKE TYSON?
-WHAT IS WRONG WITH TYSON?
-HE'S A MEATHEAD.
-MEATHEAD?
-YEAH, AS IN, YOU ONLY LIKE HIM
FOR HIS BODY.
-WHEN YOU PULL BACK LIKE THIS -
SEE MY BACK MUSCLES WORKING?
SEE THAT?
NO, I LIKE HIM, TOO.
-YEAH, YOU LIKE HIS BODY.
-OH, MY GOD, I DO!
IT IS SUCH A GOOD BODY!
-JUST SO CRAZY.
-IN A GOOD WAY.
-WHATEVER.
THE WAY I SEE IT,
THE LESS INTERESTING A MAN IS
THE LESS LIKELY HE IS
TO CHEAT ON YOU.
-WELL, DUH. I MEAN, NO ONE
WANTS THE BORING ONES.
-I DO.
-DID YOUR HIGH SCHOOL BOYFRIEND
CHEAT ON YOU
WITH THE ENTIRE CHEERLEADING
SQUAD OR SOMETHING?
-NO.
-THEN WHY ARE YOU SO AFRAID
OF GETTING CHEATED ON?
-I'M NOT!
-RIGHT.
-HI, GINGER. HI, CASSIE.
-HI, SAM.
-HEY, FOOTBALL PLAYER.
SO, YOU WANT TO GET CHANGED
AND I'LL MEET YOU BY
THE LOCKER ROOMS?
-OKAY.
-HOW YOU FEELING, BY THE WAY?
-MY FAT TISSUES ARE SO SORE.
-PERFECT.
-THANKS, COACH.
-IT'S TRAINER.
-YOU SHOULD DATE SAM.
HE WOULD NEVER CHEAT ON YOU.
-OH, PLEASE. A FOOTBALL PLAYER
AND A TERRIBLE BODY?
THERE'S NO WAY. MNH-MNH.
OH, SO A GOOD BODY DOES MATTER?
-OH, MY GOD. SAM!
YES, I CAN TAKE SAM.
THAT WOULD TOTALLY PISS
STEPHAN OFF.
HE HATES FAT PEOPLE.
-NO, NO, NO. DON'T TAKE SAM.
BE NICE TO SAM.
I AM BEING NICE.
I'M TAKING HIM OUT.
PLUS, HE'S MET STEPHAN BEFORE.
HE'D BE INTO GETTING BACK
AT HIM WITH ME.
-NO, JUST TAKE SOMEONE ELSE.
-WHY? I'LL BE HONEST
WITH HIM FROM THE START.
I'LL LET HIM KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.
-YOU HAVE TO BE.
-THIS IS SO PERFECT.
HEY, SO, I KIND OF HAVE
THIS FAVOR TO ASK.
-YEAH?
-WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU ALREADY HAVE PLANS
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT,
BUT I HAVE THESE EXTRA TICKETS
TO THIS POETRY READING.
-NO, THANKS.
-EXCUSE ME?
-YEAH, NOT REALLY INTERESTED.
-OKAY.
-POETRY?
-YEAH.
-WITH YOU?
-YEAH.
-NO.
-OKAY, I JUST WANTED
TO -- WHATEVER, IT
DOESN'T MATTER.
-ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
OF COURSE I'LL GO WITH YOU!
-WAIT. REALLY?
-YEAH.
-OKAY, BUT I SHOULD TELL YOU
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT.
-DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'M ON BOARD.
-NO, I REALLY SHOULD --
-YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE, RIGHT?
-YES, BUT --
-WAIT A SECOND.
IS THIS A DARE?
-NO.
-SOME SORT OF JOKE?
-NO, IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.
IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE
THESE EXTRA TICKETS
TO THIS POETRY READING,
AND I WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH YOU,
BUT, UM...
YOU KNOW, AS FRIENDS,
NOT LIKE A DATE DATE.
-YEAH, FRIENDS, OF COURSE.
OOH, WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?
SHOULD I GET A NEW OUTFIT?
-NO, YOU DEFINITELY DON'T NEED
TO GET A NEW OUTFIT.
IT'S VERY CASUAL, SO JUST
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
-OKAY.
-OKAY.
-VERY GOOD.
NOW, WITH YOUR ARM, PUSH
YOUR HIPS SIDEWAYS
AND GO BACK,
SWINGING BACK AND FORTH.
-I GOT A DATE!
I GOT A DATE!
I GOT A D-D-D-D-D-DATE!
I GOT A DATE!
-OKAY.
-WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
-YOU'RE IN THE GYM SO MUCH
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING TO KEEP UP.
HOW WAS YOUR WORKOUT?
YOU STILL LOOK FAT.
-THAT MAY BE,
BUT THIS FAT-ASS JUST SCORED
A DATE WITH HIS HOT-ASS TRAINER.
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T WAIT
FOR YOU TO MEET HER.
SHE'S SMART, FUNNY, BEAUTIFUL,
AND SHE'S READ JUST ABOUT
EVERY SINGLE BOOK.
-""JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH""?
-TWICE.
-IS THIS THE SHIT
THAT MAKES YOUR PISS SMELL?
-YOU'RE THINKING ASPARAGUS,
SWEETHEART.
THAT -- THAT'S BROCCOLI.
-STILL NASTY.
ANYWAY, GO ON ABOUT THIS THING
YOU'RE GONNA SCREW UP.
-I'M NOT GONNA SCREW UP THE DATE
'CAUSE TECHNICALLY IT'S NOT
A DATE.
-WAIT, WHAT?
-YEAH, SHE SPECIFICALLY SAID
IT'S NOT A ""DATE"".
I THINK SHE'S TRYING TO COVER
FOR HERSELF
BECAUSE SHE'S MY TRAINER,
IN CASE THE DATE GOES BAD,
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, RIGHT?
-I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO TAKE
WHAT YOU JUST SAID.
-HEY, WHERE'S LaSHAWNA?
-OH, SHE'S OUT TANNING
WITH GINGER.
-BUT SHE'S...
-BLACK? YEAH, I KNOW.
SHE LIKES THOSE TRIANGLE THINGS
ON HER BOOBS.
-TAN LINES?
-SHE SHOULD NOT BE TANNING
IN HER CONDITION.
-BEING BLACK
IS NOT A CONDITION, MILES.
-NO, BUT BEING PREGNANT IS.
-PREGNANT? LaSHAWNA?
-YEAH.
-YOU?
-YEAH.
-OH, GOD, IT'S IS AWESOME!
COME HERE, BUDDY.
-WHAT IS THIS?
-THAT'S AWESOME, BUDDY.
-YEAH, I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT IT, THOUGH,
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA DO
THE OLD VACUUM ROUTE,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
-REALLY?
-YEAH. YOU KNOW
HOW YOU ALREADY KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA SCREW UP
YOUR DATE?
I ALREADY KNOW I'M GONNA
SCREW UP FATHERHOOD.
SO FUCK IT. CUT IT CLEAN.
-MILES, I'M NOT GONNA SCREW UP
MY DATE.
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
-I KNOW I'M GONNA BE OKAY,
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M GONNA CONVINCE HER
WE NEED TO GET THE BIG ""A.""
THE GOOD NEWS IS SHE'S
DEFINITELY GONNA LOSE
THE WEIGHT WAR.
SO THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
CHEERS TO THAT?
-CHEERS.
MMM.
MMM.
YOU KNOW IT'S
JUST A TASTE, RIGHT?
-OH, YEAH.
TURNS OUT YOU CAN GET PREGNANT
THAT WAY.
-OR MAKE YOURSELF LOOK PREGNANT.
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
MMM. MMM.
YOU WANNA FUCK?
SO, ABOUT THE...DO-DO-DO...
-...WE GOT SOME OPTIONS.
-YEAH, LIKE, WHETHER WE
GET MARRIED BEFORE
OR AFTER.
-FUNNY. YEAH, RIGHT.
NO, I WAS THINKING, LIKE,
BIRTHING OPTIONS.
-BIRTHING OPTION.
DEFINITELY HAVING THIS
IN A HOSPITAL.
I'M NOT GONNA DO A MIDWIFE
TELLING ME TO HAVE MY BABY
IN THE BATHTUB -- BLOOP, BLOOP,
BLOOP -- LIKE A LITTLE FISH
AND PLACENTA SPLASHING ALL OVER
THE PLACE.
I DON'T DO SPLASHING PLACENTA.
YEAH, NO NATURALE FOR ME, HONEY.
GIVE ME THE DRUGS!
-RIGHT, YEAH.
DRUGS -- DRUG IT UP.
- DRUG IT UP.
SO CRAZY.
WELL, BABY, GOOD NIGHT.
-GOOD -- GOOD NIGHT.
SO, I'M JUST THINKING, LIKE,
OPTIONS, YOU KNOW, PAIN-WISE.
YOU KNOW, WHAT --
WHAT ARE THERE?
WHAT DO WE WANT TO DO HERE,
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU
GOING THROUGH THE PAIN.
-RIGHT, SO THE ONLY OPTION
IS DRUGS.
SO, GREAT. OKAY.
-I'M THINKING, LIKE,
LOOK AT THE WHOLE CIRCLE
OF CHOICE, YOU KNOW,
IN WHICH WE CAN GO SO MANY WAYS.
DO YOU WANT --
HERE'S WHERE WE ARE --
DO WE WANT TO HAVE A KID,
DO WE NOT WANT TO HAVE --
-WHOA! WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD ON. WHAT?
-THERE'S MORE.
-NO, HOLD ON.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
'CAUSE I'M NOT...
-I'M JUST SAYING, LIKE, AS FAR
AS PAIN-WISE, FOR YOU...
-- RIGHT. OH, FOR ME?
-DO WE WANT TO, YOU KNOW, HAVE,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT...
-NO, WE HAVING THE DAMN BABY,
MILES!
-RIGHT.
YEAH, NO, I'M --
-GOOD NIGHT.
-HI, EXCUSE ME.
WHICH WAY TO THE BATHROOM?
GREAT, THANKS.
-MM-HMM.
-HI.
UH, CAN I ASK YOU
FOR A BIG FAVOR?
-SURE.
-CAN YOU WATCH MY BABY
FOR ONE QUICK SECOND?
HE'LL BE FINE.
JUST MAKE SURE
NOBODY RUNS OFF WITH HIM.
-OH-KAY.
-YES?
-YEAH.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.
-HEY, BUDDY.
OH, HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
SO HAPPY ABOUT?
WHAT ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT?
OH!
-OOH.
-THIS IS CUTE.
-I HATE BABIES.
-I LOVE BABIES.
GUESS WHAT?
GUESS WHO HAS A BIG DATE
WITH CASSIE LATER?
THAT'S RIGHT, THE BIG FELLA.
-WHAT AM I DOING?
I SHOULD HAVE JUST TOLD HIM
THE TRUTH.
HE SEEMED TO BE SO EXCITED.
-OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS GONNA BE SO FUN.
I'M SO EXCITED!
-YEAH.
-I DIDN'T DRESS UP.
-NO, I CAN SEE THAT.
-BUT YOU DRESSED UP.
-NO, THIS IS JUST...WHAT I WEAR.
-IT'S NICE.
-THANKS.
THE T-THING ABOUT
THE POETRY READING
IS IT'S -- IT'S REALLY
JUST GONNA BE...
...REALLY BORING?
-OBVIOUSLY. IT'S POETRY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, THOUGH.
I'M IN.
-YOU WANT TO JUST, UM --
YOU WANT TO GO GET A DRINK?
-UH...
I SHOULD HAVE DRESSED UP, HUH?
THIS WAS A TEST.
-THIS WAS NOT A TEST.
UM...
I JUST DON'T FEEL MUCH LIKE
GOING TO POETRY TONIGHT.
-CAN I PICK THE BAR?
-SURE.
-âª I REALLY WANT YOU
BY MY SIDE âª
-YOU GUYS GOT ONE BREWSKI,
ONE H2O-SKI.
-HOW MUCH IS IT?
-$6.50.
-HERE, I'LL PAY FOR IT.
-NO, NO, I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
-I FEEL BAD.
YOU ONLY GOT A WATER.
YEAH, BUT I'M ON A DIET,
REMEMBER?
PLUS, I THINK A GUY
SHOULD ALWAYS PAY.
AND IF I DON'T DRINK,
I'M MUCH MORE PLEASANT.
CHEERS.
-OKAY, CHEERS.
BUT ABOUT THIS DIET THING,
IT REALLY IS JUST ABOUT BALANCE.
YOU CAN HAVE A DRINK
ONCE IN A WHILE.
YOU JUST HAVE TO BALANCE IT
WITH SOMETHING HEALTHY,
SO IF YOU HAVE A DRINK,
YOU HAVE A SALAD.
-SALADE?
WHAT, IS THAT, LIKE,
SPANISH OR SOMETHING?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE
MUCH MEXICAN FOOD.
SALADA.
-SAH-LAD.
-SAH-LAD.
-SALLAD?
-SALLAD.
-SALAD?
-SALAD.
-SALAD!
-ARE YOU REALLY GONNA GET UP
THERE?
YEAH, YOU KIDDING ME?
JUST GO UP THERE AND DO
ONE DUET WITH ME.
-NO. MNH-MNH.
-WHY NOT?
-WELL, ONE, BECAUSE I DON'T DO
DUETS, AND TWO,
BECAUSE I DON'T SING
IN PUBLIC, AND THREE,
BECAUSE I DON'T SING IN PRIVATE.
YOU KNOW, THE MORE YOU
LET YOURSELF GO,
THE LESS OTHERS WANT
TO LET YOU GO.
-I'VE HEARD THAT LINE BEFORE.
WHAT'S THAT FROM?
-UH, YEAH.
I WAS READING NEITSCHE,
AND THAT LINE KIND OF STUCK OUT
ON ME.
-WAIT, WHAT?
-YEAH, I PICKED UP
SOME OF THOSE BOOKS
'CAUSE I WAS CURIOUS --
THAT FRIEDRICH NEITSCHE.
-OH, FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.
-WAIT, HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE IT?
-THERE'S TWO WAYS
TO PRONOUNCE IT.
IT'S EITHER FREDERICK NEE-CHAY
OR FREDERICK NEE-CHA --
LIKE PIZZA.
- OH.
I'M GOING WITH
THE PIZZA REFERENCE, FER SURE.
PIZZA. NEE-CHA.
I LIKE THAT.
-SAM!
YOU'RE UP ON THE MIKE.
-ALL RIGHT.
SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO UP WITH ME?
THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF TIME
TO CHANGE THE SONG.
""ISLANDS IN THE STREAM""?
-NO.

-ACTUALLY, I HAD
A REALLY GOOD TIME TONIGHT.
OH, WERE YOU PLANNING ON
NOT HAVING A GOOD TIME TONIGHT?
-NO, I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.
I'M JUST SURPRISED.
-GOOD. I HAD A GOOD TIME, TOO.
WHO IS THAT GUY?
-STEPHAN.
-THAT'S THE GUY FROM
THE BOWLING ALLEY, RIGHT?
-I HAVE TO GO TALK TO HIM.
I'M SORRY.
-YEAH, OKAY. COOL.
-SO, WHAT, SEE YOU -- NOT
TOMORROW BUT THURSDAY MORNING?
-YEAH, BRIGHT AND EARLY.
-THANK YOU.
I HAD FUN.
-LET ME GET THE DOOR FOR YOU.
-OH, I GOT IT.
THANK YOU.
-FUCK.
-BE READY, YOU'RE GOING
TO REACH TO THE SIDES.
YOU'RE GONNA REACH YOUR ARMS
ON THE SIDES.
REACH TO THE SIDES.
GOOD.
MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN...
ALL THE WAY HIGH -- REACH.
GOOD.
VERY GOOD.
FEEL IT -- TO THE SIDES.
-I TRIED TO CALL YOU.
-TURNED OFF MY PHONE.
-WHAT'S IN THE BAG?
-NOTHING.
-YOU BLOW YOUR DATE?
-WORSE, I GOT SWOOPED.
YOU DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?
NO?
COOL, ME NEITHER.
-DON'T JUDGE ME, MEATBALL.
-I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT.
-NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.
-I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.
-NAH, NO WORRIES.
SO, UH, WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH HIM?
-NOTHING, WE'RE JUST GOING
THROUGH A ROUGH PATCH.
-HMM. SEEMS KIND OF NERDY.
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT HIM.
FOR THE MOST PART.
-FOR THE MOST PART?
WHAT'S THE SMALL PART YOU
DON'T LIKE? HA!
-I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS HE'S NEVER GONNA BE
THE KIND OF GUY
TO WIN ME A GIANT TEDDY BEAR
AT A FAIR OR ANYTHING.
I ALWAYS WIN
THAT GIANT TEDDY BEAR.
HECK, I AM A GIANT TEDDY BEAR.
-YOU KNOW, IF YOUR KNEE
DOESN'T HURT TO WALK ON IT,
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RUN ON IT.
-REALLY?
IT STILL FEELS A LITTLE TIGHT.
-YEAH, WELL, I THINK
THAT'S MOSTLY IN YOUR HEAD.
YOU SHOULD GET THE DOCTOR
TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN.
-YEAH.
-SO, YOU READY FOR A JOG?
-YEAH.
-ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
YOUR KNEE IS FINE.
COME ON.
COME ON.
REALLY?
THIS IS AS FAST AS YOU CAN GO?
-I'M MOVING.
I'M TELLING YOU, I THINK
YOUR KNEE IS FINE.
-I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN.
-FINE.
-SO, WHY DID YOU
GIVE UP FOOTBALL?
-WHILE I WAS REHABBING,
MY MOTHER DIED, AND --
I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS BECAUSE
SHE GAVE UP EVERYTHING
TO RAISE ME.
SHE WORKED, LIKE, THREE JOBS,
HAD NO LIFE.
I JUST REALLY WANTED TO MAKE IT
TO THE NFL SO I COULD PAY
HER BACK.
BUT AFTER SHE DIED,
I JUST STOPPED PLAYING
'CAUSE SHE JUST WASN'T THERE.
-HOW DID SHE DIE?
-HEART ATTACK.
SHE WAS BIG LIKE ME.
-WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?
-CAR ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS 10.
A LITTLE TOO MUCH
OF GRANDPA'S COUGH SYRUP
AT THE WHEEL.
-DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER FAMILY?
-MM. MEATBALL.
-WHAT'S A MEATBALL?
IT'S SOMETHING YOU PUT
IN SPAGHETTI. IT'S DELICIOUS.
IT'S ALSO MY GOLDFISH.
-SO, WHAT DO YOU DO ON HOLIDAYS?
-HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS
FOR THANKSGIVING.
DON'T REALLY CELEBRATE
CHRISTMAS.
-HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
I'M JEWISH, AND EVEN I
CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS.
WELL, WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY FAMILY,
IT MAKES THE GIFT GIVING
A LITTLE ONE SIDED.
BUT THAT MAKES ME
THE PERFECT CANDIDATE
TO BECOME A C.I.A. AGENT...
OR A NINJA.
SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
LATER TONIGHT?
-NO PLANS. YOU?
-WANT TO SEE A MOVIE...
JUST AS FRIENDS?
-JUST AS FRIENDS?
-JUST AS FRIENDS.
-OKAY.
-YES!
-JUST AS FRIENDS.
-JUST AS FRIENDS.
-KEVIN COSTNER.
-ADAM SANDLER.
-HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
THAT'S FOUR OUT OF FOUR.
YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS.
-I'M ABOUT TO BE FIVE
FOR FIVE -- ""TITANIC.""
-OH, THAT DOESN'T COUNT.
IT'S ALWAYS ""TITANIC.""
-JUST SO YOU KNOW,
ABOUT 20 MINUTES INTO THE FILM,
I'M GONNA DO THE OLD
ARM-AND-YAWN MOVE.
-THANKS FOR THE HEADS-UP.
I THOUGHT WE WERE JUST HERE
AS FRIENDS.
-YEAH, FRIENDS. OF COURSE.
THAT'S WHY I WAS GIVING YOU
THE FRIENDLY WARNING.
-OH, THANK YOU.
ANY OTHER SURPRISES IN STORE
FOR ME THIS EVENING?
-NOPE, THAT'S ALL I GOT.
SADLY, THIS IS MY ""A"" GAME.
THAT IS SAD.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD --
-YOU DON'T TALK
DURING THE PREVIEWS?
-NEVER.
-GOD, YOU WENT THROUGH
SO MUCH TROUBLE
TO MAKE ALL OF THIS.
HOW CAN I MAKE IT UP TO YOU?
LET'S EAT, AND WE'LL
FIGURE OUT A WAY.
CHIN CHIN.
-WHAT THE HELL YOU
DOING BACK HERE?
-GETTING SOME EXTRA CARDIO IN.
-HOW DID THE THING
WITH CASSIE GO?
-WHAT?
-HOW DID THE THING
WITH CASSIE GO?
-AWESOME!
-YEAH?
-IT'S SO WEIRD 'CAUSE WE'RE
SO OPPOSITE IN SO MANY WAYS.
-RIGHT, YOU'RE FAT,
SHE'S SKINNY.
YOU LOVE HER, SHE HATES YOU.
YEAH.
-RIGHT, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHY SHE LIKES
HANGING OUT WITH ME,
BUT I FIGURE, DON'T ASK.
-IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS.
-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
-DADDY ISSUES.
-HUH?
-NO? OKAY, PICTURE THIS.
AVERAGE GUY IS WALKING DOWN
THE STREET.
HE'S WALKING BY ALL THESE
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS,
AND ALL HE'S THINKING ABOUT
IS TRYING TO HOOK UP, FEEL UP,
SCREW, BANG, DATE --
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.
ONE DAY, HE FINALLY SNAGS ONE,
LOCKS IT DOWN,
GETS MARRIED,
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.
BANG! WIFEY SHOOTS OUT A KID,
BUT NOT JUST A KID --
A BABY GIRL.
WELL, WHAT IN THE HELL IS HE
SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS?
THIS IS THE SAME TYPE
OF CREATURE
HE WAS JUST TRYING TO NAIL
A FEW MONTHS AGO.
NOW HE'S SUPPOSED TO RAISE IT?
HOW?
WELL, SINCE HE'S A DUDE,
HE DOES WHAT MOST DUDES DO
AND IGNORES IT, YOU KNOW,
LIKE LAUNDRY.
BUT IT KEEPS GROWING,
AND EVENTUALLY
IT TURNS INTO THIS PRE-TEEN
SHE-DEMON HORMONAL BITCH.
ADIÃ³S, PAPA BEAR,
AND HELLO, DADDY ISSUES.
SO, WHAT'S THE ISSUE?
SHE WANTS A DADDY WHO LOVES HER.
EVERY GIRL DOES.
AND WHEN SHE DOESN'T GET THAT,
SHE STARTS PLAYING THIS
TWISTED GAME
WHERE SHE FINDS ANY GUY
THAT REMINDS HER OF HER FATHER
AND TRIES TO DO WHATEVER SHE CAN
TO EARN HIS AFFECTION.
THIS IS WHY YOU SEE HOT CHICKS
WITH JACKASSES.
SHE'S CONVINCED IF SHE CAN JUST
GET THAT GUY TO LOVE HER,
IT'D BE THE SAME FEELING AS
HAVING HER OWN DADDY LOVE HER.
OF COURSE, IT NEVER WORKS OUT
THAT WAY.
SHE JUST ENDS UP IN A STRING
OF BAD RELATIONSHIPS
WITH DUDES THAT ARE IDIOTS.
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S
AN OBVIOUS MISMATCH
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.
SO A LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS THAT
CASSIE HAS SOME DADDY ISSUES.
NOW YOU MIGHT THINK THIS IS FINE
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING TO DATE
SOME HOT CHICK
WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE,
BUT HERE'S THE DEAL.
THE ULTIMATE GOAL
FOR THESE GIRLS
IS TO GET SOME REVENGE.
ONCE SHE GETS A GUY LIKE YOU
TO LOVE HER,
SHE'S GONNA TAKE CONTROL
AND WALK OUT,
JUST LIKE HER FATHER DID.
-WOW.
-YEP.
-SPEAKING OF FATHERS...
HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOU
AND LaSHAWNA?
-THEY'RE GOOD. THEY'RE GOOD.
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.
UM, WE DECIDED TOGETHER
THAT WE'RE GONNA KEEP IT --
KEEP THE BABY -- SO...
-WOW. CONGRATULATIONS.
-YEAH. YEAH.
OF COURSE, IF IT'S A GIRL,
IT'S GONNA HAVE MAJOR
DADDY ISSUES.
IT WAS A...JOKE.
GO AHEAD AND RUN.
I'LL SEE YA.
-YAY!
-YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
OH.
-ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE SET.
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SUNDAY NIGHT?
-NOTHING. YOU?
YOU WANT TO GO OUT?
-SURE.
YOU WANT TO SEE A MOVIE?
-A DATE.
-WHAT?
-A REAL DATE.
NOT AS FRIENDS.
A DATE DATE.
-OH.
I DON'T KNOW, SAM.
I KIND OF LIKE THE WAY
THINGS ARE NOW.
-I'M JUST SO CONFUSED.
WE HAVE A GOOD TIME TOGETHER.
-WE DO.
-IF IT'S MY WEIGHT, YOU KNOW
I'M TRYING TO WORK IT OFF.
-IT'S NOT THAT.
-WHAT IS IT THEN?
-I JUST FEEL LIKE THINGS
ARE UNFINISHED WITH STEPHAN.
-WELL, YOU'RE NOT SEEING HIM
NOW.
I KNOW 'CAUSE I SEE YOU
EVERY DAY.
-NO, BUT I KNOW
OUR RELATIONSHIP,
AND WE'RE GONNA
GET BACK TOGETHER.
-WELL, YOU'RE NOT TOGETHER NOW.
WE STILL HAVE TIME
TO GO ON ONE DATE.
AND IF IT'S HORRIBLE,
WE'LL FORGET THIS THING
EVER HAPPENED.
BUT IF IT'S GOOD...
ALL RIGHT, ONE DATE.
-YES!
ARE YOU GONNA GET A NEW OUTFIT?
-NO.
MAYBE. NO. NO.
CAN YOU JUST DO
10 MORE, PLEASE?
-OKAY.
HEY, DUDE.
-WHAT'S UP?
-GUESS WHO'S GOT A DATE
WITH CASSIE TONIGHT?
-HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE.
WELL, THIS TIME
IT'S OFFICIAL OFFICIAL.
-RIGHT.
-IT IS.
-WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
-WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
-AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
WORKING THE FRONT DESK TODAY?
-I SWITCHED WITH WENDY.
-YOU'RE HAVING A KID.
-SHH. YEAH,
THANK YOU FOR REMINDING ME.
ANYWAY...
-BE SMART, MILES.
LaSHAWNA LOVES YOU.
SHE'S GONNA BE THE MOTHER
OF YOUR CHILD.
IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU TO TRY
TO MAKE THIS RELATIONSHIP WORK.
-YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT WOULDN'T HURT ME.
THANK YOU, DR. SAM.
-ALL I'M SAYING IS, DON'T PRESS
THE NUCLEAR BUTTON
JUST BECAUSE YOU RAN OVER
A FEW SPEED BUMPS.
-I'M HAVING A KID.
THAT'S A NUCLEAR BOMB.
SO THAT BUTTON HAS ALREADY
BEEN PUSHED -- REALLY HARD.
AND THERE ARE CERTAIN TRUTHS
TO LIFE,
LIKE I'M GONNA SCREW UP
FATHERHOOD.
YOU'RE GONNA SCREW UP
THIS THING WITH CASSIE.
TYSON'S GONNA SCREW
ANY GIRL HE WANTS,
MOST LIKELY WITH HIS SHIRT OFF.
IT'S JUST THE WAY
THE WORLD WORKS, MAN.
YOU GOT TO ROLL WITH IT.
-I'M NOT GONNA SCREW THIS THING
UP WITH CASSIE.
-RIGHT. PROVE ME WRONG.
I GOTTA PISS.
-I'M NOT GONNA SCREW THIS THING
UP WITH CASSIE!
I'M NOT.
-LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
THE WRONG BATHROOM..
UNLESS YOU WANT TO USE
ONE OF THOSE...
WHICH I DON'T RECOMMEND.
-SO...
UH...
AH, THE OL' ZIPPER.
UP AND DOWN.
ZIPPER.
-ZIPPER.
-ZIPPER GOES UP AND DOWN.
-âª I JUST CAN'T LOVE YOU
ANYMORE âª
- AND DOWN.
-âª BUT I'M NOT QUITE OVER YOU
âª I GUESS I'M NOT QUITE
OVER YOU âª
âª AND ALL THE PAIN
YOU PUT ME THROUGH âª
-OH, ROUGH.
-âª BUT AS YOU DRAG
MY HEART ALONG... âª
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T DO THIS.
-WHY NOT?
-I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
-SO?
-NO, NO, NO.
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU SHOULD
KNOW --
SHE'S PREGNANT.
- SO?
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I WANT TO MAKE IT WORK WITH HER.
SO...
SORRY.
YOU WANT, UH -- YEAH,
THIS IS YOURS, YEAH.
THIS --
WHAT?
UM, THANK YOU.
I HATE YOU. YEAH.
-I'M NOT GONNA SCREW UP
MY DATE WITH CASSIE!
I'M GONNA BLOW IT
WITH CASSIE, HUH?
-YOU'RE GONNA DO FINE, OKAY?
LISTEN TO ME.
IF I CAN TURN DOWN
A CRAZY-ASS DRUNK GIRL
IN A BATHROOM,
YOU CAN HANDLE A LITTLE DATE.
AH, TA-DA. HUH?
-IT'S A DRINK.
-ITA DRINK.
I FIGURE YOU HAVE ONE,
MAYBE LOOSEN YOU UP A BIT.
BUT JUST ONE, OKAY?
-WHOA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
-I LIVE HERE.
-YOU HAVE TO EXCUSE
MY IRRATIONAL, PREGNANT
GIRLFRIEND, SAM.
-REALLY?
-YEAH, YOU GONNA WALK AROUND
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR LIKE THAT?
-WELL, YEAH, I'M SURE IT'S
NOTHING HE AIN'T SEEN BEFORE.
YOU HA SEEN A GIRL IN
HER UNDERWEAR BEFORE, RIGHT?
-OF COURSE HE HAS, AND HE
WILL AGAIN TONIGHT. RIGHT?
SEE, HONEY, SAM HERE
IS NERVOUS AS SHIT,
SO I FIGURE IF WE HAVE A LITTLE
DRINK, IT'LL LOOSEN HIM UP
A BIT.
-THAT'S A BAD IDEA.
-A BAD IDEA, I KNOW.
IT'S AN AWFUL IDEA,
BUT IT'S THE ONLY ONE I'VE GOT.
-EXACTLY.
-JUST ONE DRINK.
-ONE DRINK.
-SUCH A BAD IDEA.
-WE'RE DOING IT.
ONE DRINK.
-JUST ONE DRINK.
-ONE DRINK.
-ONE DRINK.
-ARE YOU OKAY, SAM?
-I'M FINE, CASSIE.
YOUR NAME HAS ""ASS"" IN IT.
WHAT A MIGHTY FINE ONE YOU HAVE.
YOUR ASS, NOT YOUR NAME.
YOUR NAME IS KIND OF WEIRD.
-ARE WE READY TO ORDER?
-YES. I WOULD LIKE
THE CAESAR SALAD TO START,
AND THEN I WILL HAVE THE FILET
MEDIUM RARE,
AND CAN YOU HOLD
THE GREEN, SPINACHY STUFF
THAT COMES ON THE SIDE?
I DON'T WANT THAT.
BUT I WILL DOUBLE UP
ON THE CREAMY MASHED POTATOES.
THANK YOU.
-VERY GOOD.
AND FOR THE LADY?
-I WILL HAVE A GRILLED CHICKEN
AND SOME ASPARAGUS, PLEASE.
JUST NO SAUCE ON THE ASPARAGUS.
-PERFECT. AND CAN I GET
SOMETHING FOR YOU TO START WITH?
-NO, THANK YOU.
-HAVE YOU DECIDED
ON A BOTTLE OF WINE?
-I THINK WE'RE OKAY.
-...TO ORDER ONE!
WHY DON'T YOU GO GET US
A BOTTLE OF RED, HUH?
SOMETHING EASY ON THE WALLET,
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
THIS THING AIN'T GUARANTEED?
-I THINK THAT I DO.
I'LL JUST BRING YOU
THE HOUSE CAB, OKAY?
-PER-FECT.
-OKAY, I'LL BE BACK
WITH YOUR WINE.
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST KIDDING
ON THE WHOLE
""NOT GUARANTEED"" THING.
HEY, REMEMBER WHEN I SAID
""SAH-LAD""
LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT?
THAT WAS FUNNY.
I'M REALLY FUNNY.
-SAM, WHAT'S GOING ON?
-I DON'T KNOW. YOU TELL ME --
WHAT IS GOING ON?
-I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO HAVE A NICE DINNER.
-I THOUGHT WE WERE.
-YOU'RE DRUNK.
-YEAH, BUT YOU CAN CATCH UP.
YOU KNOW, THAT IS
A GOOD QUESTION.
WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHY ARE YOU OUT HERE WITH ME?
-YOU ASKED ME OUT.
-AND YOU SAID YES BECAUSE...?
WHAT?
DO YOU FEEL BAD FOR ME?
-HERE WE ARE.
I THINK YOU TWO WILL LIKE THIS.
IT'S GOT A SLIGHT PEPPER TASTE,
SO IT'LL GO WELL WITH
YOUR STEAK AND YOUR CHICKEN.
OKAY?
IT'S EASY ONT HE WALLET,
AS WELL.
-AH!
GREAT.
-I'M OKAY, THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, I-I THINK I'M ACTUALLY
GONNA GET OUT OF HERE,
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.
YEP.
I REMIND YOU
OF YOUR FATHER, RIGHT?
-WHAT?
-HE USED TO PLAY FOOTBALL,
PROBABLY DRANK TOO MUCH.
-YES, AND HE WAS AN ASSHOLE,
JUST LIKE YOU'RE BEING
RIGHT NOW.
WHAT IS YOUR POINT?
-MY POINT IS,
YOU JUST WANT TO RELIVE YOUR
FAILED RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
BUT THIS TIME, YOU JUST WANT TO
TAKE CONTROL AND WALK OUT.
-MY FAILED RELATIONSHIP?
SAM, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
-YOU'RE TRYING TO USE ME
TO SOLVE YOUR DADDY ISSUES.
-YES, AND THAT ALL MAKES SENSE
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT I HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOU WERE A LOUSY DRUNK
OR AN ASSHOLE UNTIL TONIGHT.
AND THE FACT IS, SAM, YOU'RE
NOT A FOOTBALL PLAYER.
YOU WORK AT A BOWLING
ALLEY, WHICH IS FINE.
AND DESPITE WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE TONIGHT, I KNOW YOU'RE A
REALLY NICE GUY.
SO IN REALITY, NO, YOU'RE REALLY
NOTHING LIKE MY FATHER.
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD START LOOKING
AT YOUR OWN ISSUES
BEFORE YOU START TELLING
OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THEIRS.
AND FOR THE RECORD,
I CAME HERE TONIGHT
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY LIKE YOU --
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.
-HOW ARE WE DOING?
-I'M LEAVING.
-SHOULD I HOLD HER ORDER THEN?
-NO. YOU CAN BRING IT.
I'LL EAT IT, TOO.
SHE HAS DADDY ISSUES.
WOMEN.
MEATBALL...
MEATBALL?
MEATBALL!
MEATBALL, LOOK AT ME.
MEATBALL, I'VE BEEN STARVING YOU
THIS WHOLE TIME, BUDDY.
IT'S NOT YOU THAT HAS TO GO
ON A DIET, IT'S ME.
I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO GO
ON A DIET.
HERE, YOU WANT SOME FOOD?
HUH?
YOU WANT SOME?
LET ME GIVE YOU
A LITTLE DESSERT, HUH?
THERE YOU GO, BUDDY.
YOU LIKE THAT?
MEATBALL.
FOOD! EAT IT!
I'M GONNA GO EAT IT.
SHIT.
HEY.
-HEY.
-I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.
-YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.
-LOOK, I MESSED UP.
I'M SORRY.
-IT'S OKAY.
-IT'S JUST EVERYTHING
WAS GOING SO GOOD,
BUT I WAS NERVOUS
ABOUT GOING OUT WITH YOU,
AND I WANTED TO IMPRESS YOU,
SO...
I STARTED DRINKING.
-APOLOGY ACCEPTED.
-WE HAD FUN.
-YEAH, WE DID.
-A BUNCH OF US ARE PLAYING POKER
AT MY HOUSE LATER,
IF YOU WANT TO COME.
-SURE.
-SO, I'LL SEE YOU THEN?
-OKAY.
-OKAY.
-IT'S A FIVE-CARD DRAW, KIDS,
SO GET LOOSE AND COMFORTABLE.
THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME --
LOOSE AND COMFORTABLE.
-SO, HOW FAR ALONG
ARE YOU, ANYWAYS?
-GOTTA BE AT LEAST SIX MONTHS.
-WE DON'T KNOW YET, OKAY?
WE JUST GOT ALL THAT
INSURANCE STUFF WORKED OUT.
BUT WE HAVE OUR FIRST DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT TOMORROW!
-THAT'S RIGHT --
WE HAVE OUR FIRST
DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT TOMORROW.
I'M NOT LETTING HER GO ALONE.
I'VE SEEN PORNOS. I KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS.
TYSON, YOU
CAN BACK ME UP ON THIS.
-YEAH, FOR SURE.
-YOU GUYS ARE DUMB-ASSES.
-IT'S OKAY, SAM.
YOU INVITED HER.
I'M SURE SHE'LL COME.
-YEAH.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH, HONEY,
FOR BEING HERE.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
-YEAH, OF COURSE.
-MMM. MMM.
-HOW MANY OF THOSE
HAVE YOU HAD TODAY?
-I'M EATING FOR TWO, MILES.
-OKAY, RELAX.
OH, COME ON, MAN.
WHERE THE HELL IS THIS GUY?
-HE HAS A LOT OF PATIENTS --
UNLIKE YOU.
GET OFF THE CHAIR!
WHAT ARE YOU, A KID?
-WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
-IT'S THE DOCTOR'S CHAIR.
-SO?
-DO YOU HAVE A PhD?
-NO.
OKAY, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE.
-GOOD AFTERNOON.
-GOOD AFTERNOON.
-DOCTOR.
UM, IS IT TWINS?
IT FEELS LIKE TWINS.
-IT LOOKS LIKE TWINS.
-LET ME ASK YOU TWO SOMETHING.
DID YOU GUYS BY ANY CHANCE
USE ONE OF THOSE
HOME-PREGNANCY TESTS?
-MM-HMM. IT'S CALLED
LOOKING IN THE MIRROR.
YEAH.
OKAY, WELL, WE RAN
THE BLOOD TESTS,
AND WE DID THE TEST HERE,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU, LaSHAWNA,
ARE NOT PREGNANT.
-EXCUSE ME?
-IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.
-NO, IT LOOKS LIKE LaSHAWNA
IS PREGNANT.
THAT'S WHY LaSHAWNA'S HERE,
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S PREGNANT.
-IT'S OKAY. HOLD ON.
JUST LET ME JUMP IN ON THIS.
UM, SO YOU'RE SAYING
THERE'S NO KID IN THERE?
-AT THE MOMENT, LaSHAWNA
IS, UH, TOTALLY KID FREE.
-OKAY, UM...
BUT I'M SHOWING
THE SYMPTOMS, SO...
-WELL, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, THERE
CAN BE A LOT OF REASONS
FOR SYMPTOMS
LIKE, UH, TENDER NIPPLES,
VOMITING, CRAVINGS.
-LIKE WHAT?
-WELL, AN UNHEALTHY DIET,
FOR STARTERS.
-SO, DOCTOR, LET ME JUST BE
100% WITH THIS.
AIN'T NOTHING IN THERE?
-NOTHING.
WELL, I'M SORRY.
I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE.
-THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
YOU OKAY?
-I WILL BE.
-COME HERE. SORRY.
-IT'S FINE.
IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BEST,
RIGHT?
-YEAH, FOR SURE. I MEAN,
WE CAN ALWAYS TRY AGAIN LATER.
-WHAT?
-LATER, WE CAN -- LATER IF WE
WANT TO HAVE A KID,
WE CAN ALWAYS TRY...
-TRY AGAIN?
-LATER, THOUGH, YEAH, BUT YES.
A LOT -- A LOT OF TIME BETWEEN
FROM NOW TO THEN PROBABLY.
-YEAH.
-SO DON'T BE BUMMED, OKAY?
- THANK YOU.
-OR TOO EXCITED.
SO, FUNNY STORY --
LaSHAWNA'S NOT PREGNANT.
-YOU GOT THE BIG ""A,"" HUH?
-NO, NO.
TURNS OUT SHE NEVER WAS.
-WELL, THAT'S GREAT NEWS, MILES.
-YEAH.
AND I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY GONNA
SOUND STUPID TO YOU,
BUT I WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT,
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT.
-YOU'D BE A HORRIBLE FATHER,
MILES.
YOU EVEN SAID SO YOURSELF.
-FUCK YOU.
I'M SURE I WOULD SUCK,
BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY, RIGHT?
OTHERWISE, WHAT'S THE POINT?
YOU GET THAT, RIGHT?
-LEAVE A FLOWER, SAM.
DON'T TRY TOO HARD.
OKAY, BIG FELLA.
LET'S DO THIS.
-OH, OH, PERFECT.
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME.
COULD I ASK A HUGE FAVOR?
-SURE.
-THAT'S A GIANT TEDDY BEAR.
-YEAH.
-YOU WORK AT THE BOWLING ALLEY,
DON'T YOU?
-RIGHT.
I KNEW I RECOGNIZED YOU.
HERE -- THANK YOU --
COULD YOU JUST HOLD --
I'M TRYING TO HELP MY SON.
-OKAY.
-OH, HERE.
-LOT OF STUFF YOU GOT THERE.
-WELL, MY BOYFRIEND
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE,
BUT AS ALWAYS, HE'S LATE.
OH, I NEVER THOUGHT
THIS DAY WOULD COME.
HE'S JUST INSIDE GETTING HER.
JUST, OKAY...
-OKAY, SHE'S COMING OUT
ANY SECOND.
SHE'S JUST PUTTING ON HER SHOES.
DID YOU PROCURE THE FLOWERS,
MOM?
-WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M HOLDING?
-AND THE SIGN -- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DID NOT MAKE IT FLOWERY.
-I MADE IT PRETTY.
-YEAH, I PRETTY MUCH
SHOULD BE GOING.
-OH, MY GOD.
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT
BRING A TEDDY BEAR, MOTHER!
-NO, THAT'S HIS.
HE WAS JUST WALKING BY.
HE WORKS AT THE BOWLING ALLEY.
-YEAH, REALLY,
I SHOULD BE GOING.
I'M SORRY.
-HELLO?
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?
-CASSIE.
-JUST ONE MORE SECOND.
-I'VE MADE SOME BIG MISTAKES
IN MY LIFE,
AND I'M SURE THAT I'M GONNA MAKE
A FEW MORE.
OKAY, I'M -- I'M SO SORRY
TO INTERRUPT YOU, BUT --
HI, SAM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING...HERE?
-HE'S HOLDING THE SIGN!
-YOU KNOW HIM?
-WELL, YEAH, I'M HIS TRAINER.
BUT I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.
-I'M SORRY. I SHOULD BE GOING.
-HE WORKS AT THE BOWLING ALLEY.
-OKAY. RIGHT.
ANYWAY, WHAT I WANTED
TO STATE WAS
I WANT TO MAKE
MY MISTAKES WITH YOU,
AND I WANT YOU TO MAKE
YOUR MISTAKES WITH ME.
I LOVE YOU
TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE.
THE SUM OF MY FEELINGS
EQUALS 360.
NEITHER PYTHAGORAS, DESCARTES,
NOR MADAME CURIE CAN CALCULATE
STEPHAN'S AFFLICTION
FOR THEE, CASSIE.
NOW PLEASE RULE OUT
THE PROBABILITIES
AND AGREE TO SINE AND COSINE
THIS LIFELONG DECREE.
SO I ASK YOU NOW
ON BENDED KNEE...
CASSIE -- SIGN --
WILL YOU MARRY STEPHAN TODAY?
-WELL?
-YES.
-OH!
OH, THIS IS WHAT MAKES
A MOTHER SO PROUD!
-I'M GONNA GO GET SOME FOOD.
-HEY, EVERYBODY!
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!
-MILES!
LaSHAWNA!
ASSHOLES!
ASSHOLE, YOU READY FOR ME?
BITCH.
QUITTER!
YOU FUCKING QUITTER!
MEATBALL!
-IT'S OUR --
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?
-ENGAGEMENT.
-OUR ENGAGEMENT.
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
-CONGRATS.
-I'M STILL IN DISBELIEF
THAT YOU SAID YES.
THIS IS A HAPPY DAY.
ARE YOU HAPPY?
-I'M HAPPY.
-I KNOW MY MOM IS HAPPY.
SHE'S HOPING I'LL MOVE OUT NOW.
OH, JESUS.
-WHAT?
-THEY'RE DOING
THAT STUPID KARAOKE THING.
THIS IS WHERE YOU AND I
MAKE SUCH A GOOD PAIR.
YOU WOULD NEVER SEE
ONE OF US UP THERE MAKING
A FOOL OF OURSELVES.
-YEAH.
-SORRY, I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE
THAT THEY DID THIS HERE.
MUST BE A SPECIAL NIGHT THING.
-THAT'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW,
I STILL HAVEN'T TOLD MY MOM.
-YOU SHOULD DO THAT.
-YEAH, I THINK I'M GONNA
GO OUTSIDE AND CALL HER.
IT'S REALLY LOUD IN HERE.
-OKAY, I'LL WAIT
FOR THE APPETIZERS.
HEY...
YOU WANT TO LEAVE SOME MONEY
IN CASE THEY LEAVE A BILL?
-I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
-OKAY.
-âª I REALLY WANNA BE WITH YOU
âª I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY DO âª
âª YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
âª I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY WANNA BE
WITH YOU âª
âª YEEEEEAH
-âª YEEEEAH
-âª LAST NIGHT I HAD A DREAM
âª IN A FIELD OF PURPLE FLOWERS
âª I HAD SOME SPECIAL POWERS
âª SO I THOUGHT YOU WERE THERE
âª AND YOU APPEARED
âª THE SUN WAS FLOATING
IN THE SKY âª
âª THE RAIN WAS WET,
BUT WE WERE DRY AND WARM âª
âª WE HAD NO VOICE
âª WE SPOKE WITH OUR TELEPATHY
âª I FELT ALL THAT YOU
FELT FOR ME âª
âª AND UNDERSTOOD
WHAT I NEVER COULD âª
-THEY HAVE ROBERTS
LOADED ON TO THE CART.
AND AS THEY'RE WHEELING HIM
TO THE LOCKER ROOM,
HE'S GIVING A THUMBS-UP
TO THE CROWD --
ALWAYS A GOOD SIGN.
KNEE INJURIES ARE ALWAYS TOUGH
ON THESE PLAYERS,
ESPECIALLY THE ONES
WHO RELY ON SPEED LIKE SAM.
PHYSICALLY HEALING FROM THESE
INJURIES IS ONE THING,
BUT MENTALLY
YOU HAVE TO WONDER
IF THEY CAN TRUST
THEIR KNEE AGAIN.
WILL THEY BE WILLING TO RUN
FULL OUT?
ONLY TIME WILL TELL.
-SO, WHEN'S THE DATE?
-I DON'T KNOW.
WE HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT YET.
-YOU DON'T SEEM OVERLY EXCITED.
-YEAH? I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST THOUGHT I'D BE MORE
INTO IT BY NOW,
BUT...IT'S JUST WEIRD.
MAYBE I'M JUST GETTING USED
TO THE IDEA.
HOW'S SAM DOING?
-GOOD.
MY BROTHER SAYS THAT HE'S STILL
WORKING OUT IN THE PARKS
IN THE AFTERNOONS.
-THAT'S GOOD.
-YEAH.
-HEY.
YOU'RE RUN RUNNING.
-YEAH. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT WAS MOSTLY IN MY HEAD.
-YEAH.
YEAH, WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANKS
FOR BEING SO COOL
WHEN STEPHAN...YOU KNOW...
-OH, I'M A COOL GUY, SO...
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
-YEAH, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU
COULD HAVE REALLY FREAKED OUT.
I MEAN, I WOULD HAVE.
-THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
CONGRATULATIONS, BY THE WAY.
HE'S A LUCKY, LUCKY GUY.
-THANKS.
-SO, HAVE YOU, UH,
SET A DATE YET?
-THAT'S A POPULAR QUESTION.
UM, NO.
NO, WE HAVEN'T.
-OKAY.
-OKAY, WELL,
IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU.
-YEAH.
SEE YOU AROUND.
-HEY, DO YOU WANT TO GET
A COFFEE WITH ME --
OR SOMETHING?
-I'M TRYING TO CUT OUT
ALL DAIRY.
-OH, YEAH.
THAT'S TOTALLY SMART.
OKAY, WELL,
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND THEN?
-OKAY, BYE.
-BYE.
-SO TODAY'S THE BIG DAY.
-FOR WHAT?
-THE WEIGHT WAR.
-WHAT?
WE'RE STILL DOING THAT?
-I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS WHO WON.
-WHO?
-SAM.
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S DONE ANYTHING.
-WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'VE BEEN STARVING MYSELF.
-HOW MUCH WEIGHT HAVE YOU LOST?
-TWO POUNDS.
-YOU LOOK EXACTLY THE SAME.
-I'M REALLY HUNGRY.
I REALLY WANTED THAT MONEY.
-HONEY, I TOLD YOU --
BLUEBERRIES.
FULL OF ANTIOXIDANTS.
YOU WOULDN'T BE HUNGRY,
AND YOU WOULD'VE LOST WEIGHT.
-THANK YOU, TONY ROBBINS.
-ANYWAY, HOW MUCH WEIGHT
DID YOU ACTUALLY LOSE?
-I DON'T KNOW.
ABOUT 12 POUNDS.
WHAT?
IT WAS A FLY.
-SO WE ALL AGREE
SAM'S THE WINNER?
YEAH, AS LONG AS I AIN'T GOT
TO GET ON NO SCALE,
I'M COOL WITH ALL OF THAT.
-CONGRATULATIONS, BUDDY.
YOU ARE THE BIG WINNER.
-ALL RIGHT, SAM.
WAY TO GO.
-CASSIE WOULD BE SO --
WHAT?
-IXNAY ON THE ASSICAY.
-IT'S OKAY, GUYS.
JUST SO EVERYONE KNOWS,
CASSIE GOT ENGAGED AND --
YEAH.
-I'M SORRY, SAM.
-I DIDN'T LIKE HER ANYWAYS.
-SHE SMOKES.
-WELL, IT IS WHAT IT IS.
I SAW HER AT THE PARK TODAY.
-YOU SAW HER TODAY?
-YEAH, SHE CAME BY TO SAY HI.
-OH, YEAH. I TOLD HER
THAT YOU WORK OUT THERE.
-SO YOU TOLD HER
THAT HE WAS GONNA BE THERE,
AND THEN YOU RAN INTO HER?
-YEAH.
-AM I THE ONLY ONE
CONNECTING THE DOTS
ON THIS ONE?
-DOTS?
-OKAY, LET'S SAY YOU GOT
A BIG, GIANT, JUICY
CHEESEBURGER.
YOU WALK UP TO IT.
ARE YOU JUST GONNA SAY HI,
OR ARE YOU GONNA EAT
THAT MOTHERFUCKER?
-I'D PROBABLY EAT IT.
-YOU'RE HER CHEESEBURGER.
SHE DIDN'T GOT HERE TO SAY HI.
SHE WAS HUNGRY.
-CASSIE DOESN'T LIKE
CHEESEBURGERS.
-I WANT A CHEESEBURGER.
-OH, MY GOD. THERE'S THESE
GREAT BLUEBERRY BUNS.
-OKAY, FORGET THE CHEESEBURGER.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT FOOD.
SHE RAN INTO YOU ON PURPOSE.
-HE ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE
THIS TIME.
-OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS EXHAUSTING.
-SHE WANTS A CHEESEBURGER.
SHE WANTS A CHEESEBURGER.
SHE WANTS A CHEESEBURGER --
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE
ANY SENSE.
WAIT.
SHE WANTS A CHEESEBURGER.
I'M A CHEESEBURGER.
I'M A CHEESEBURGER!
SHE WANTS ME!
OH, MY GOD!
I'M A CHEESEBURGER!
THAT'S STUPID.
HI.
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
-I'M A CHEESEBURGER.
WHAT?
-I KNOW, IT'S STUPID.
UM, ABOUT THAT CUP OF COFFEE?
MAYBE I DON'T HAVE TO CUT OUT
DAIRY COMPLETELY.
MAYBE I JUST HAVE TO HAVE
BALANCE AND HAVE, LIKE,
A SALAD OR SOMETHING.
-A SALAD?
WHAT IS THAT, LIKE,
MEXICAN, OR...?
SAH-LAD, SAH-LAD!
YEAH.
-ANYWAY, I KNOW YOU'RE ENGAGED
AND EVERYTHING.
I'M NOT...ENGAGED --
ANYMORE.
-YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED?
-NO.
-WHAT HAPPENED?
-HE JUST WASN'T THE RIGHT GUY
FOR ME, YOU KNOW?
-CRAZY.
-YES, WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS
SOME MADNESS IN LOVE,
BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME REASON
IN MADNESS.
-FRED PIZZA.
-FRED PIZZA.
SO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
-UH, UM...I WAS WONDERING --
DO YOU WANT TO GET
THAT CUP OF COFFEE?
-YES.
-WAIT, I WASN'T READY FOR THAT.
CAN WE KISS AGAIN?
-YEAH.
-WAIT A SECOND.
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?
-OH, WELL, I FOUND HIM
ON THE STREET
OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE, BUT HE WAS
SO CUTE AND BIG AND FLUFFY,
I JUST HAD TO
KIND OF TAKE HIM IN.
HOW ABOUT WE HAVE THAT CUP
OF COFFEE HERE?
-REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
I MENTIONED THE WHOLE
DADDY ISSUE THING
AND HOW CASSIE WOULD DEFINITELY
LEAVE SAM?
WELL, MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE OFF.
OKAY, I WAS --
I WAS WAY OFF.
AS IT TURNS OUT,
CASSIE WAS SOMEHOW ABLE
TO SEE BEYOND SAM'S SLIGHTLY
CHUBBY EXTERIOR.
AND WHILE SAM WORKED OFF
THE OLD POUNDS
ONE AT A TIME --
LIKE REALLY SLOWLY --
CASSIE STUCK AROUND.
I GUESS FOR HER,
SAM IS WORTH THE WAIT."
28,A Bigger Splash (2015) - full transcript,"In A BIGGER SPLASH, the lives of a high profile couple, a famous rock star (Tilda Swinton) and a filmmaker (Matthias Schoenaerts), vacationing and recovering on the idyllic sun-drenched and remote Italian island of Pantelleria, are disrupted by the unexpected visit of an old friend (Ralph Fiennes) and his daughter (Dakota Johnson) - creating a whirlwind of jealousy, passion and, ultimately, danger for everyone involved.","Marianne!
Marianne! Marianne! Marianne!
I hate that sound.
It's unknown.
- Hello?
- Aha! I found you.
Guess who it is.
Marianne, I know you're resting,
but you have to be better.
When it happened to Adele,
- she was yodelling again in three weeks.
- Harry.
You think I didn't do my homework?
Listen.
- I'm landing in Pantelleria in five minutes.
- Harry, listen, it's Paul.
Meet me there and boy!
- Do I have a surprise for you and Paul!
- We're at the lake. Harry.
I've got to go.
I'm landing in five minutes.
He's calling from the plane.
He said he's got a surprise for us.
I don't want that
to be the last great thing I ever do.
I mean,
maybe you're my swan song, love!
Jesus, does he ever stop?
My god.
Hey!
Is it you? Is it you? Yes!
God!
I am so fucking happy to see you!
Why didn't you let me know you were
here? You know I love this place.
I'm in Rome all summer.
You can talk, can't you?
Come on, tell me you're better.
Yes, you are. What?
Ah, what? Not at all?
Well, the doctor said two more weeks.
It's the kid. Hey!
Come here, you old bucket.
- You look fantastic!
- Oh, thanks.
You look sexy, kind of metro-sexy.
I'm sorry we didn't call,
but we're hiding out.
What? Hiding out? Well, not from me.
Come on! Not any more, anyway!
Come on,
when I'm finished with you,
you'll be singing
those gravelly Gs again.
Oh, Penny, Penny, come here!
Right, Pen, meet Marianne and Paul.
- Hi!
- Oh, you brought a protÃ©gÃ©e.
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm his daughter.
- Excuse me?
- The looks on your faces!
I'm sorry,
I should have warned you.
Everyone's making
the same mistake. Pen, say hello.
Hi! Yeah, he really loves it, though.
She seems shy, but she is
a lovely bitch, like her mother.
And underneath, she is
every inch my girl, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- I think so. We're kind of..
- Where are your wheels? Let's go.
- Uh, right in front.
- So you didn't get a room?
- Is that going to be a problem?
Yeah.
It's San Gaetano tomorrow.
Ah! Shit. Yes.
No, 'cause last year they did it late
because of the ferry strike.
Okay, anyway, doesn't matter.
Oh, I know where we should go.
We can go squatting at Fabrizio's.
He'll put us up.
But now, keep going, it's up here.
There's a restaurant in the hills here
and, Pen, you're going to love it.
It's amazing.
Fantastico! Pantelleria!
Ta-da!
You didn't know this was here?
Don't tell me you've been eating
out of the fridge all this time.
They only serve dinner
and only until September.
Then it's fallow again until June.
Harry, come on, that's a grave.
Yeah, well,
Europe's a grave.
Oh, ah, fuck.
So when did this happen,
you and Harry?
Last year. I finally put some pieces
together and figured it out.
Mm. You're on your college break?
On your Grand Tour?
Yep. Normally I'd be spending the
summer in Connecticut with my mother,
but she gets sick of me. Annie!
She gets sick of me
and she just ships me off somewhere.
This year, it was to Harry.
So... you again?
Happy? Say yes.
- Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?
- Happy to see me?
Oh, fuck. It's full.
Shall we tell them who you are?
Oh, we don't do that anymore, Harry.
Well, I think we may have to
'cause it's absolutely choccer.
Good evening.
Good evening.
- A table for four.
- I'm booked, fully booked.
Maybe tomorrow.
- Marianne Lane. Do you know her?
- No.
She's famous.
- It's Marianne Lane!
- Who?
It's Marianne Lane, that's her!
The place is full.
Rosario! Give him this table.
Fine.
A table just freed up.
Go take a seat.
Thanks.
Okay, guys, we're good I think.
Your name did it.
Thanks!
- Good evening.
- Thanks. Do you know Marianne Lane?
- Harry!
- Hi.
Unbelievable, my God!
Good evening...
Good evening, madam.
It's Harry. Did you arrive from where?
Oh, from Rome. Hello.
Hello!
- You look great!
- Thanks!
Everyone, this is Harry!
It's the same group
of people wherever you go.
- So what are you going to have?
- No, she can't talk, all right?
I would love a daiquiri.
- Marianne!
- Have a daiquiri!
Hotels are booked solid. There's meant
to be one room left at the Yacht Marina
and Piero says there's a queen bed
we could use on the boat.
At any rate, we got to get out
and enjoy the weather tomorrow,
'cause the sirocco's on its way.
That's the warm wind from the Sahara
I was telling you about.
- With rain?
- No, it's dry, with sand.
Marianne, Paul's headaches,
are they a problem here?
Harry, stop this fucking shit,
all right? She can't talk.
- I'm not going to repeat it!
- Of course she can talk.
When Bjork had her operation,
after two weeks she was-
I don't give a fuck what Bjork said,
all right? Or Adele.
No. Nothing's a problem here.
Nothing a few Nurofen
can't take care of.
What is your name?
What is your favourite colour?
Seriously, you want me
to deck you? Fucking...
What is your quest?
To not end up like Julie Andrews.
Get it?
Excuse me, four daiquiris.
No, three...
- Not for me.
- Oh, fuck, shit, yeah, sorry.
What, what, what did she say?
- She says her feet hurt.
- No!
That's what she said.
She's getting a blister.
If you've got something to say,
say it to me.
She's asking you to stay.
Oh, Christ, that took forever.
- Is there a pool?
- Mm-hm.
Ah. Yeah, this place isn't bad, eh?
Where are they?
They're shooting
a commercial in Thailand.
Uh-huh.
Well, where am I?
No, it's down at the property.
It's a little dammuso.
It used to be a stable for the donkeys.
Oh, far away.
Safe distance, eh?
Mm-hm!
You can't talk or won't?
Cancer?
Oh, right.
Your career.
Cool.
I'm 22, you know.
Cool.
Fuck!
Woo! Woo!
Look! Woo!
Fantastic!
Aha, okay. What have we got here?
How are the pots and pans?
Uh-huh.
What have we got in the frigo?
Oh! Scandalo. Orribile.
Terrible.
How are you guys living?
What we have here?
Your mum... huh?
It's cute.
You off to bed?
Thank you. Mm.
For having me to stay.
All right. Here you go darling.
Your pill.
Good night.
Good night.
She's got tour dates
this winter, doesn't she?
What's she planning to do?
Well, she's kicked everything into the long
grass and it was the right thing to do.
Jesus, man. It's hard to watch.
Is she like this when you fuck?
I mean, how does it work?
Does she write you a note
when she cums?
Come here.
You wish we were at a hotel.
- I didn't say that.
- You forget, I know how you speak.
- Oh yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.
Mm?
I've been teaching myself
some Italian finally.
Oh! 101 useful phrases?
Well, no, I'm not reading Boccaccio
if that's what you mean.
Vaffanculo. Go fuck yourself.
Go take it up the arse, in fact.
Cacasentenze. Someone who pretends
to be very smart,
who won't stop talking,
one who shits sentences.
And my favourite is
vomitare I'anima.
To puke your guts up.
Literally, to vomit your soul.
Wow.
I noticed you didn't drink
at dinner. Are you all right?
I mean, does it bother you
that I'm drinking?
Do you know what
vai a cagare means?
Ah, yeah.
You know, well, there,
you got it, just drop it, all right?
Yeah, but are you all right?
Hard part's over, yeah,
rehab and all that.
Yeah.
Good night.
Good night!
Good night, good night!
Phil,
you've got to be fucking kidding me.
Are you happy?
The head
of the label told me to my face
that he considers those masters
""Done"" with a capital fucking D.
If he's going to change his mind now...
You asked him to stay.
Why is that?
You feeling nostalgic?
Do you want to play that for me now?
Don't let him know we can talk like this.
You know we can't be naked
any more, right?
Marianne! Over here my swan.
Oh, there you are!
What have you got there?
Oh, I've been waiting for you.
- Have you? I was looking for you.
- Sweetie. Mm.
- Please, don't stop.
- Can I play your drum?
- My drum?
- Yeah.
We've got to leave at 11 o'clock.
- No! Later.
- The car's coming.
- Later. Later. Make it later.
- We can't move it.
They won't be happy.
They will not be happy.
- Make it later. I'll make it worth it.
- You will?
Mm.
What are you doing? Quit splashing.
Look what a good job I'm doing, Clara!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Hey, more surprises, huh?
Where'd you find this thundercat?
I can't get her off my elbow.
What is thundercat?
What is thundercat?
What is thundercat?
- Nonna I'd like to fuck.
- Hey!
Oh, yeah, you had nothing
and now you have everything you need.
Zucchini for Paul and a little heaven
for everyone else.
We're having for lunch orata al sale!
How gross! Chilli, no!
Just herbs.
Herbs only, yes. I'm your slave.
Hey!
""I grew up in a Britain where racism
was woven into the fabric of society
""in a way that would be difficult
to imagine today.
""I was of a generation that challenged it
politically and physically.
""We confronted far-right thugs,
organised street patrols
""to protect black and Asian families
and stood up to police harassment.
""Patriots wish us to be equally unthinking
in our attachment to the nation in every...""
Oh.
Ah. What the fuck's that?
Is that a snake? Euch!
No.
It's just another whip snake.
Ew! Orribile! Get rid of it!
We have them every day.
Pen!
- How's the room of the ass?
- A delight.
How's the room of the monk?
Oh, they made it! Great, great, great!
Fantastic!
You'll love them. Salty and sweet.
Oh, you're fine. It's hot
and they're communists
and you're not speaking sweetheart,
so I had to make other plans.
- Hey!
- Hey!
Buongiorno!
I want to go in that car
one day, sweetheart!
- Tchuff!
- Tchuff!
This is the house
that Jonas has bought.
You can make a hell of a lot
more cash directing music videos
than record producing, apparently.
Oh, I shot a video with Jonas!
Here she is. Here's the lady.
Marianne, I'd like you to meet
some very old friends of mine
Mireille and Sylvie. Marianne Lane.
She can't talk I'm afraid.
That's rock 'n' roll for you.
It squeezes you like a lemon,
then it throws you out.
Oh, but you're going to sing again!
This is not forever.
- And this is Paul.
- Guess who I am.
Oh, my dear. I know who you are.
So lovely.
You're daddy's little rascal
we've been hearing about.
He told me once that he'd lost six grand's
worth of cocaine out in the parking lot.
I mean, I've only seen that much
cocaine in my life maybe twice.
When he told me. I nearly had
a fucking seizure in the green room.
I... I couldn't let it go,
the thought of it lying out there
under somebody's Dodge Caravan
or pick-up or whatever,
so I got a dozen roadies to come out
and shine their cell phones and torches
under the cars while he finished his set.
I mean, this is a stadium, remember,
so thousands and thousands of cars
and this group of roadies
going around going,
- ""Where is it? Is it here?""
- And they found it?
No. They never found it.
Somebody else won that lotto.
He told me later that he had planned
to kamikaze the whole lot that night
and if he had,
then we would've found him
covered in shit and fizz the next day
on the bathroom floor.
Mm. But I think that losing that bag,
it saved his life... for a while.
To be a genius is to be unruled.
To be unruled is to be alone.
Well, er, yeah...
for the first part maybe.
- My sister has attempted suicide.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Twice. Pills both times.
- Oh.
It's the height of vanity, you know?
You can't imagine her embarrassment
when she discovered that she lived.
Yeah, well, you know,
no one should be ashamed.
No. No. I tell her to call me
if she feels it coming over her again.
Now, every time the phone rings
I resent her a little more
- and I think that...
- Oh!
Mind your feet.
- You can't live forever.
- Exactly. None of us can.
Oh, Marianne will.
Ah, we've bored her.
- Tchuff!
- Tchuff!
No, well,
it was something unbelievable
and that was when the Stones
came into their own, so to speak.
They killed their fathers, so to speak,
in front of millions of people
and the first real casualty
of that was Brian Jones.
Wait a second, I'm sorry.
Don't you think we should kill
the light in the booth?
Yes, brilliant! Just right!
- Good idea!
- All right. Make it black as you can.
Paint it black.
I'll buy you a beer for that.
What's your name?
- Paul. Pleased to meet you. Hello. Hi.
- Harry. Pleased to meet you.
She's the woman of the century
and I'm talking about her soul now.
Underneath all the shit, the shellac,
the noise, she's grounded.
She's a fucking empath.
When the spaceships come in,
she'll be right out in front
with her arms wide open,
""Come, come to me, beautiful aliens!""
You're an idiot, man, seriously.
You should meet her.
Why do you keep doing this?
- We're done.
- No, you're not.
- Your bed's not even cold. Come on!
- Paul, look at me. We're done.
Marianne and I have
different music to make,
different... different shit.
And on top of all of that, she's
a trumpets-of-Jericho, white-hot fuck.
- I don't want to hear it.
- She fucks and she fucks and she fucks.
Does she?
- Yeah.
- You don't want to do this, man.
Yeah.
Yeah, Tom. Tom, just, like, don't...
Don't lay off that kick drum,
all right?
Keep it going like a heartbeat.
That's it. Ba-pa-boom! Ba-pa-boom!
Ba-pa-boom! Ba-pa-boom!
- Are you happy Harry?
- Uh, nearly.
I'm not crazy about the sound
I'm getting off the hi-hat.
- Could we move the microphone?
- Can we fix it and then can we go?
- Can we fucking go?
- I got it, Harry.
Yeah.
- Hey, praise fuck, you made it. Yeah!
- Good to see you, man.
Come here.
We're just to go for a take, Paul.
- All right. Let's hear.
- Come, come, come.
Uh, Marianne, Paul.
Paul, Marianne.
Hello!
Onward pagan soldiers.
Okay, let's go.
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!
Ah! Who won?
- Harry... maybe.
- Er, no, no, he won.
Just about, just... just... Woo!
Champion!
See? I still got it.
Oh!
Sylvie! Ah!
Three more boats have
sunk here coming from Tunisia.
I want you to send down
Laurent and a photographer
Check this out.
Why are we listening to this? You want
to end up in a padded room? Fuck.
- It was on the turntable.
- I know, but it's shit!
What have we got here?
No, no, no, Roxy Music, no. Uh-oh!
Some of this is good shit.
Ah, ah, ah, ah! Look what they have!
Wait, where's Pen?
Pen! Pen!
Pen!
Pen! Come hear what Daddy made!
Come on!
Okay, I think Marianne's heard this.
Sylvie, do you know this album?
I can tell you a little story about
my contribution to Rolling Stones history.
Just after Darryl came in
and I was working with Don Smith,
who'd done
a lot of Keith's solo stuff with me
and we were at Windmill Lane in Dublin
and it was raining.
Non-stop Irish rain,
it wouldn't fucking stop
and I was quitting smoking,
so it was coffee, coffee, coffee
and this song,
which you are going to hear,
it just wasn't fucking working.
Keith is insisting no drums, you know?
We're working away and I think,
no, no, I go to Keith and I say,
""Okay, so can Ronnie do
a track on pedal steel?""
He goes, ""Yeah, but no drums.""
So I'm thinking ""What the fuck!""
So I give Mick castanets.
So you've got Chuck Leavell
on the harmonium
and everyone is folding in
all this beautiful shit,
but this song is not taking off,
so I say to Keith, ""Do you trust me?""
He goes yeah. ""If I promise no drums,
can we do a percussion track?""
He says,
""What's Charlie going to play?""
And I'm thinking,
""What is Charlie going to play?""
But I'm asking myself what's
the sound, something, not too crisp
and I look over
and I see in the corner...
- Wait, what is it?
- What is it?
Wait, listen, what is it?
It's not a drum.
- What is it?
- Listen, listen!
What's that? She knows.
Listen!
- It's a trash can.
- No!
It's an aluminium fucking trash can.
So I put Charlie out in the stairwell,
we put a mic three floors up
and Keith's shaking his head
'cause he knows I'm right.
As soon as Charlie starts
banging on it, we're off.
A can for trash.
Human evolution in the key of C.
Yeah, all that and you still can't
fucking move to it, you know.
Okay, what else have we got?
Aha! Okay, this is tops.
- You produced this?
- Christ, no. I was 16!
This is tops.
I didn't know it then, but I do now.
Woo!
Did he not cook for you
when you were together?
Marianne did, or it didn't happen.
Her mother was mad for cooking.
It runs in her family.
Did you ever meet her finally, Paul?
Yeah, last year in the hospital.
Pen, she was a woman
to know. I loved everything about her.
I can't believe that the clock can
just run out on a woman like that.
Who is coming to the festival tonight?
- What?
- San Gaetano!
Well, I can't, I, uh...
- Why?
- Why?
It's one of the best nights
in the year! Everybody will be out.
Music horrible! Dancing horrible!
Food horrible! You can't stay away!
- And the police band is playing.
- The police band? Fuck!
Yes.
They're not so bad you know.
At least come for the fireworks.
Mais no, mais no!
There is no fireworks, cherie.
I got to test some lenses
before the weather breaks.
- Come for the no fireworks!
- Come!
Will you come?
Paul's got to score lenses. You go free!
We can lend you the Mehari,
so you can join us later.
Oh, very kind of you!
Hey, I just spoke to Robin.
I'm on Kossakowski's shortlist
for his documentary.
No!
You want to choose a dress for me?
It's a bit plain.
Very charming.
Now, promise me, no talking tonight.
Some are
on the island now, hiding.
Last year, one of the boats was spotted
and the smugglers just threw
everybody overboard to try to flee,
whilst the coastguards
did the rescues.
But the goal, of course, is
France. A lot of them have family there.
- There you go, Tunisia.
- Tunisia.
Ah.
You can smell the jasmine from here.
Oh, guys it has already started.
Try to behave, my angel!
Yes!
I was talking to my daughter,
but you can be an angel, too.
I'll be your angel.
A drink without guilt.
Now, frankly,
it's sentimental to think
you can help Paul
by not drinking in front of him,
or not talking about it for that matter.
Come on, it was a year ago.
I mean, if he can't even hear
the subject mentioned,
you don't have to go kicking over glasses
and it's just ridiculous.
And people talk about addiction,
they talk about suicide. It happens.
You know, I doubt
he wanted to kill himself anyway.
If you ask me, he wanted
to kill the whole world, Marianne.
Yeah, come on.
I mean, we both know him.
It's misdirection.
That's what they call it.
A case of psychic misdirection.
Anyway, sorry.
You both look great together.
He takes very good care of you. No,
I mean it. He does. You look fantastic.
You both look amazing.
Wonderful, wonderful to see you.
And you know,
this invalid thing, it suits you.
Yeah, no it does,
'cause the roles are reversed
and Paul can nurse you for a change.
Oh, come on, I didn't mean it like that.
Fuck. Okay! Okay!
All right, all right, all right.
Nice dress, nice dress!
Of course. Yeah.
I'll see you, yes?
Bye, see you.
You were my hero until just now.
Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't stay away.
You all right?
She was just boring
the life out of me is all.
- You didn't look bored.
- Yes, I know. Thank you.
My trouble is that I fall in love
with every pretty thing.
That sounds paralysing.
Try not to frighten the horses.
I always loved you saying that.
It was always funny to me, 'cause you
always frightened the fucking horses.
You, whereas with Paul...
What's the point of Paul
in your life now?
I was angry with you.
Yeah, I know I was slutting around,
but you took everything so hard
and now look what I've done.
I've...
thrown you this square.
Yeah, he's square, Marianne.
He's a square bear.
He's all cuddly and built
for hibernating with and he stuck.
I will always be
grateful to you for Paul.
How are you dealing with this? Mm?
What if it doesn't come back?
You know, it might not come back.
Have you thought about that?
It's your fucking life!
Your voice is your fucking life!
Bet that you'll just reinvent
yourself again, won't you?
Is wearing your mother's clothes,
is that reinvention?
I don't think so. Anyway, I suppose
you'll have your mummy phase
and I have my daddy phase.
But one way or another we're just going
to grow old together, aren't we?
I'm happy, Harry.
Can't you stand that?
Would you think I was being ingratiating
if I said I wanted to make documentaries?
Just pick up a camera and go film
the kids in Mansoura or something.
Oh, have you been there?
- I wouldn't let that stop me.
- Well, you want some advice?
- Why? Because I'm a girl?
- No.
No, you should definitely go to Mansoura,
or Detroit, whatever moves you.
Just don't do it the Harry way.
Just lay low, keep your mouth shut.
You know, don't take a camera.
Go empty-handed, seriously.
You'll humiliate yourself any other way,
trust me. I know everything about it.
All right. I'm not afraid of that.
Do you want some?
- No. I don't smoke.
- Doesn't mean you don't want some.
Yes, it does.
You must have been really desperate
to crash your car like that.
Excuse me?
He said you were shot out of it,
really far...
and you didn't leave a note or anything.
That's what he said?
He thinks it's the most
interesting thing you've done.
He thinks you're too conceited
to stand being addicted to anything.
I'm guessing he's talking about drinking.
Are you waiting for
a reaction or something?
Don't waste your time.
...And now let's play Pi?ata!
Go right, go right...
Go!
Well done, Francesco!
Well done!
And next up is...
Good evening!
- Thanks for the table.
- You're welcome!
That's the guy who gave us the table.
Come on! Let's perch over here.
When did we last do this?
How many years ago?
When we were innocent babes.
Come on! Come on!
Oh, fuck, there's nobody here.
Good evening.
We don't have available tables.
- What do you have?
- Karaoke.
Karaoke?!
Oh, no, he says the screen is broken.
Oh, fuck.
Can I have a glass of sparkling water?
Find something we'd be
embarrassed to sing anywhere else.
Come.
Come here. Okay!
Mm. Okay.
Marianne! Marianne!
Marianne! Marianne!
Marianne! Marianne! Marianne!
Marianne! Marianne!
Woo!
My daughter...
Come on!
Can I have her after
you're finished with her, Daddy?
Daddy!
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.
Marianne!
Marianne! Marianne!
Marianne!
Marianne! Marianne!
Marianne! Marianne! Marianne!
- That was fantastic.
- Oh.
- Oh!
- Good night, girls.
Mireille! Good night.
I told you I was going
to drive the car. Now I'm going to.
I'll keep my hand on the stick shift!
Mm. Was it Mireille?
Yeah.
Hold on, give it to me. Let me...
Mm. By the way, what's...
Remember that woman he was with?
Um...
She was teaching at NYU.
What's her name again?
Yeah, Christie.
They were swinging right?
- What did you say? Dusty Christie?
- Busty Christie.
Yeah, she had huge melons!
You remember?
You remember they were swinging, right?
Yeah. Now, what was it?
Groups, men, college...
Boys, college girls.
What?
He'd fuck everything.
That's what I'm saying.
Well,
if you're talking about Penelope,
I'll tell you that
whatever's going on there,
it's mutual and it's a great couple.
Come on, look at them.
Really! Come on.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
So, that makes all of us.
He must just not know
how it looks with Penelope.
I think I should say something.
Trust me.
She can handle herself just fine.
Which one of these do you prefer?
Me, too.
Well, that woman drives
like a lunatic. You know that.
But I was driving
and she, she distracted me.
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.
Listen, I think if it's both of us,
then we can push it together.
You need a tow truck.
That's what you need.
- Oh, Christ. Will you come or not?
- A tow truck.
They both tell me yes,
but I don't think he really is.
I mean, we don't even really look,
or act very much alike at all.
I'm going to ask him to take the test.
There are reasons I'd like to know.
Private reasons.
- What the fuck happened?
- I was going and coming at the same time.
- Where's Mireille?
- She went home to wash her mouth.
How the hell
do you want us to move that?
Oh, well, let's hope
it won't roll forward.
I think, if we release the handbrake,
we can put it back on to the road.
All right, let's push it.
- Careful.
- Yeah.
One, two, three.
All right.
Okay and again.
All right, yeah, let's go.
One, two, three.
Fuck!
This is not going to work.
Forget about it.
Jesus Christ!
Too hot for white people. Fuck!
You're pretty domesticated
for a rock star.
You were with Harry
for what, six years?
And you've been
with Paul for how long?
Cool.
I heard that there used to be six songs
on either side of a record album.
You'd hear six and then you'd have
to flip the thing over to hear more.
You know what?
I bet they put one really good song
on each side,
so you just keep flipping it over.
By the way, have you seen my iPod?
Because that sneaky Harry is
always trying to get into it
to see what I've been listening to.
So you're working again.
- Yeah, I'm shooting for hire nowadays.
- Yeah?
For a Russian master,
Kossakovsky. You know him?
- No.
- Six-country shoot.
- Uh-huh.
- It keeps me busy for a while.
When are you finishing yours?
- Oh, you remember that?
- Yeah of course.
Lost Dog, American Journalism
in the 21st Century.
You showed me
that amazing Cronkite interview.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what?
You're not giving that up too,
are you?
You shot all that footage. What is it,
just lying in a drawer somewhere?
No, actually it's in a closet.
Five hard drives, but that can wait.
Yeah, well,
adjust your goals, not the world.
Is that the same advice you'd give Pen?
No! She's young. She should change
the world any chance she gets.
I think the women should change things
now anyway. We've had our chance.
Anyway,
you will find your way back to it.
You just got to get your finance,
good editor, some guts.
Just shut the fuck up, all right?
Just stop talking and we'll be fine.
Can you do that?
Thanks a lot.
I thought it was a good observation.
It's the way you give it.
It's not very careful.
Well, it's how I care, isn't it?
Honesty is the greatest fidelity.
Yeah, well, the world is not
ready for your honesty.
I don't believe in half truths.
Oh, you used to.
Yeah, well,
I learned my lesson then, didn't I?
Not in time, but I learned it.
I think going bust with Marianne was the
great dumb tragedy of my great dumb life.
It feels good to say it to you.
You learned your lesson in time,
though, didn't you?
I mean, that's the important thing.
Thank god for emergency rooms, eh?
Hey! How did my beauties sleep?
- My adorable ones!
- Did you get the car out?
No, we couldn't move it.
We need Clara to tell us what to do I think.
Whoa! Oh!
Can I borrow the wheels?
I want to see people.
Pen, you want to come?
What? Groceries?
Okay, we'll go together.
I need more treasure.
Throw your watch in.
- I'm reading.
- Well, I need a shipwreck.
Throw in a chair.
I'm not going to throw in a chair.
I'm sorry.
Mister Paul! I'm finished.
I'm going to the village.
Okay, Clara.
Shouldn't you be going
round the island?
Go check it out.
It's pretty beautiful out here.
I wouldn't know where to go.
There's a lake pretty close by.
A lot of kids come out,
bring guitars, play music.
It's fun. You should check it out.
Show me.
It's half day, market day
and this wind is not sirocco!
Fast first and then slow,
one doesn't understand what it wants.
It's weird... go while it isn't there.
It's two miles from here.
It's not so far.
- Walking?
- Yeah, it's a proper hike.
You should be up for it.
Okay.
You want to see me do a handstand?
Yeah, go ahead.
The Allies bombed
the hell out of this island.
Maybe the market's up here, no?
I think it is.
Bit of a beaten up old town.
I think it's down here. Yeah.
It can look
a bit full-on, a bit, you know, it could...
In a situation like last night,
it could be misconstrued.
What do you mean?
What do you mean, Marianne?
What shit!
I'm too brash. I'm too impulsive.
I'm too a lot of things,
but Christ, I'm sound.
I mean, look, if you asked me,
do I find my daughter sexy?
Have I caught myself
enjoying the sight of her?
Yeah, I have.
I didn't know her until a year ago,
so yeah, it's a little odd.
I acknowledge and I deal with
the shit that goes on in my head.
Coming from Paul,
this would be outrageous.
Paul is Paul,
but coming from you, it's...
I mean, what is the impulse here?
To humiliate me or...
What is it, really?
Harry! This is not about us!
Isn't it? We've been testing each other
ever since I got off the plane.
Well, I've never stopped, but...
I mean, come on, it's me!
Stop this lying to yourself.
Listen!
I am not going
to leave Paul for you!
Oh, what? You don't...
What, you thought
I was here for the capers?
They used to process slaves
on this island. Did you know that?
I hate this fucking island.
Look, let's not get things confused!
I'm not fucking my daughter!
Oh!
So fucking predictable!
Big enough audience?
Are you kidding?
We...
We just made their vacation.
Haven't we?
I did leave a note.
But anyway we tore it apart
when I, uh...
when I got out of the hospital.
You and Marianne?
Yeah.
What did it say?
Uh, just her name.
I wanted to write it down one last time.
I want you to see this!
Giuseppe?
Si.
Good morning.
- She's my friend, Marianne.
- Come in.
- Morning, Rosa.
- Hello, how are you?
My friend, Marianne.
- Do you recognise her?
- Yes.
Please show us how you make ricotta.
Civil Protection volunteers are ready
to assist arriving migrants.
First reception procedures
have commenced...
Come here.
The ricotta will be coming up.
Coming up, coming up.
Within a few hours,
a reception centre was set up.
At 11:00 PM
the fishing boat docks at the port.
The migrants wave
and thank rescue workers,
thankful they've arrived safely.
Even the children,
held by their parents, wave hello.
People who were desperate
in their homeland...
- Come and see the ricotta.
- Taste it while it's warm.
Marked by horrors of war,
they hope for a better future...
Medical exams confirm
that only a few migrants
need to be hospitalised...
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Mm.
- Good?
- Very good!
Okay.
Mm.
Okay?
No, you...
You don't need to apologise... ever.
You never have.
Well,
they got to be here somewhere.
They must've gone off
for a hike or something.
You do the ricotta?
Here, be careful.
Do it like this
Turn it around... like that.
Come on.
This is you. It's in you.
Let it out for me. Come on.
Come on, this is happening.
It's happening.
Darling, no.
He put a bell on your neck, right?
I'm glad he did.
- I can love you now.
- No.
Don't be angry.
I love you.
Then we shouldn't see
each other anymore.
In sixth grade,
they offered an opera class at my school
and I was hooked.
La Momma Morta.
""I'm love. I'm love.""
I had to conquer
all things Italian after that.
Ah. We were going to start without you.
I'm sorry. We got kind of lost.
Uh-huh.
Parmigiano please, Pen.
Thanks.
So you two must be starving.
You went swimming as well, no?
- We did.
- Where? At the lake?
Um, no, actually, uh,
Paul took us to the cliffs.
Oh.
We dived and dived and dived.
How was the wind?
I'll need a spoon to scrape the sand
out of my eyes, that's for sure.
Mm-hm.
Well, you got your beach, then,
more or less.
It was better than a beach.
Actually,
there are a couple of beaches here,
like micro beaches or something.
I don't know what they call them.
But really tiny, just for three
or four people. It's beautiful.
You can do anything
you like out there really.
If the wind dies down,
that's what we do next.
You'd love it.
By the way, did Marianne make this?
- Yeah.
- This is so good, I can tell.
Cilantro. That's her signature.
She'll put it in anything.
What? Will she?
Yeah.
By the way, they always say in
Pantelleria, people eat a lot of capers,
but so far we haven't eaten any, right?
Oh, I have.
Fucking gecko, shit!
I think I'm going to go watch
a movie or something.
- Are you good?
- Yeah, are you?
Yeah, I'm just beat from the day.
Pretty beat.
Okay.
Good night, Pen.
Good night.
I hope she didn't catch cold.
She's just tired. It was a long day.
Mm.
Swimming...
Swimming can take it out of you.
How was your day? Any good?
Pen? It's Harry.
Come in.
Sorry, um, it's just...
You asked me to tell you when
I was ready to go back and I'm ready.
Okay.
I've had my vacation.
Did what you wanted to do?
It was fantastic.
I'll remember it always.
Yeah, well, maybe go tomorrow.
Good night.
Night-night.
I got your pills.
I'm done with him. Aren't you?
All the little snakes are sleeping.
Mm.
Oh, fuck!
Are you waiting for me?
Sh.
That's a nice surprise.
If you have something
to say to me, say it.
- Keep your voice down.
- What, you think I'm plastered?
Tonight's not the night for it.
No, tonight is definitely
the night for it.
Paul, fuck! Seems you agree, eh?
Why don't you do me a favour?
Go to bed.
Harry, listen. We need to talk.
No, I need to pack.
I need to wake Pen up.
I need to be out of here by dawn.
I don't particularly want
to see you in the light of day.
Yeah.
I'll take a cab for the morning, so, uh,
thanks for the use of your car, sir.
Oh. Are we fighting?
I'm sorry.
- You're too much. Fuck.
- Harry, come on.
Why don't you go wake
my daughter up, eh?
You can tell her to pack and we'll
get the fuck out of here right now.
Did you fuck her or not?
- Did you fuck her or not?
- Did you fuck Marianne?
It's not the same, man.
- You know what the problem is?
- You know what the problem is...
is I gave you too much credit.
We were friends.
Better than brothers.
Better than all those shits in their lofts
talking about who the fuck cares what
And now you just...
you just tolerate me.
Do you know
how offensive that is to me?
Think what you want, judge the hell out
of me, but don't fucking tolerate me.
- You don't deserve either of them.
- Neither do you.
You have no idea of the shit
that I got her out of... off of.
Well, I got her off you.
What? I gave her to you.
You're obscene.
We're all obscene.
Everyone's obscene.
That's the whole fucking point.
We see it
and we love each other anyway.
Love? I was wondering how long
it would take you to pull that...
You hit me.
You hit me!
All right, Paul.
I don't know what I'm doing either.
Here, help me out, will you?
Yeah, come on, I'm sorr... Oh!
What is this?
Let go!
Ah! Argh!
Come on!
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me!
Harry, come on, come on, come on!
Madam, madam...
Mr Harry in the pool.
Dead. Dead!
Ah! No! Argh!
Don't scream!
Your voice, madam,
you'll ruin your voice!
Don't scream!
Calm down...
- Morning, Marshal.
- Good morning.
What are you doing?
Don't touch it.
Mister!
Good morning, Marshal La Mattina.
Hello, sir.
What is that? Do you know?
That thing...
It's... It's an album.
Emotional Rescue
by the Rolling Stones.
- What'd he say?
- I didn't hear.
It's music.
Oh... vinyl?
May I?
Can I have some water please?
There you go, sir.
Are you OK, madam?
So, Clara...
first I need to know at what time
Mr. Hawkes went swimming in the pool.
What time Mr Harry...
in the water?
The bath. Splash, in the water.
Well, he went out after dinner,
around ten o'clock
and we were asleep
before he came back, so...
Around 10:00.
- No, no.
- No, no, no!
No dieci. After dieci.
- After 10:00.
- After 10:00... I see.
And them?
When did they go to sleep?
Ask them.
What time, uh, you...
In the bed.
12:00. And...?
You too?
And the gentleman?
Um, around 1:30.
And then I took a sleeping pill.
- He took drugs.
- You took drugs?!
Drugs? No, of course not. It...
Jesus, it's a medicine,
all right, to go to sleep.
Ah!
- Pills to sleep.
- To sleep, OK.
Listen, I'm wasting too much time!
I have 30 people to question.
What can we do?
It's not their fault, poor things.
Tell them to come
to the police station at 2:00.
And I will find a suitable translator.
Oh! He says, uh,
station carabinieri, two!
At 2:00. All three of them.
And wear shoes!
Let's go, guys.
IDs please?
Passport.
Thank you.
We put them all here in an enclosure,
but it's inhumane, it's shameful.
School isn't in session,
can't we put them there?
There's 12 of them, got it?
They're human beings, theoretically.
Mister.
Here we are.
Paul De Smedt.
Morning.
You can speak English or French.
Take a seat.
Are you hurt?
Of course.
I'll be sad forever.
No, I'm...
Yesterday...
Paul, he has a wound.
Did you see it?
Yeah.
Here. On the side.
Do you understand me? Don't talk!
Maybe you didn't understand,
I'm not asking for a favour,
the fridge in Kamma is broken.
Tell Giuppy to take out all the meat,
the corpse will go bad in this heat.
Show some respect.
You're talking about my father.
Is it too much to ask?
You're right miss, sorry.
I'll call you back.
10 more minutes.
Madam, would you follow me, please?
Have a seat.
We know you recovering from surgery
and it's not easy for you to talk.
Turn off this phone,
it's been ringing for an hour!
How long you
and Mr De Smedt friend?
You were awake...
You were awake last night?
Mario, give me a hand
looking for the IDs,
or the Marshal will be pissed!
Will he?
Does he know where to look
in this mess here?
The sand at the bottom of the pool...
...showed movement.
As if several people were in the water...
Or maybe only two.
Two moving around a lot.
Or maybe fighting.
Oh!
If you are talking about charging
Paul De Smedt,
I need to call my lawyers.
No, no, don't worry.
What a beautiful bag... Beautiful...
Maresciallo will found out
what happened.
He must take care of other drownings.
Yesterday,
seven immigrants died in the sea.
Survivors are deported to
detention centres in the mainland.
Immigrants in Lampedusa
are more than locals now.
It's a tragedy.
It start here, but go far.
When did you find them?
12:00, yesterday.
And seven drowned in sea.
There is a path.
To the house.
It comes up behind the pool.
You saw it.
And anybody could...
...come up there,
when Mr Hawkes was swimming and...
...we would never have heard them.
She's thinking of the refugees.
He will ask them.
They cannot be more offended
more than they already are.
Poor things...
Ah, the girl.
You and Mr De Smedt
have to stay here now,
but the girl,
she can travel if she want.
But she need
her mother to sign the letter,
because minors cannot travel
without consent of the parents.
She's underage, madam.
She's 17.
Paul! Paul!
I tried to save him.
I tried, I tried, I tried.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
Yeah?
Hi, It's me.
Huge fucking crowd out of there.
They're turning people away.
So, Derrick tells me that
Worried About You is off the set list.
- Is that true?
- Mm-hm.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
- Harry, don't ask me to do...
- I'm not asking.
...sentimental things for you,
anymore.
It's not fair on Paul.
Stop that, would you? Just stop it.
- Yeah.
- Marianne, it's time.
Okay.
It's not about fucking Paul.
You know that.
Come on.
Why are you resisting me?
It's done.
Don't let it upset you.
Marianne! Marianne!
Well, do you want me
to let you know
if there's some kind of service
for friends or something?
Why did you lie to us?
I didn't lie.
You're not 22, you're 17.
Christ, you're still in high school.
You speak Italian.
Yeah, yeah.
And you sat there
over and over with people...
struggling to communicate
with one another.
You like to watch people
having a hard time.
Is that it? Is that the kind
of woman you want to be?
I would just rather be left alone.
It's different.
No! That's not different.
I wasn't your enemy.
None of us was.
Don't let it upset you, okay?
Mm.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.
On behalf of our Alitalia crew,
we'd like to welcome you aboard
this flight to Rome Fiumicino.
Loading operations are being completed
and we'll be ready to leave shortly.
The flying time will be approximately
one hour and ten minutes.
Weather-wise,
whilst it's raining here in Pantelleria,
the forecast for Rome is
bright and sunny
with a temperature
of about 30 degrees Celsius.
We thank you for flying with us.
Madam!
Madam!
Ms. Lane, excuse me!
I need to tell you something.
Mario!
Go away!
Madam...
Can you write your name, madam?
My name?
Your name, there? Write it?
Okay.
Your name.
Carmelo.
Carmelo, madam.
Thanks, madam!
You are fantastic.
You are fantastic.
This is mine alone.
From you... to me.
Mine alone, madam.
Okay, I got to go.
Yes, yes...
Madam...
You very nice people.
You go home now.
He's a fan.
A fan."

MR. SECRETARY, PLEASE
READ THE MINUTES.
UM, WHERE'S-WHERE'S CAROLINE?

WHY?
MOSTLY BECAUSE HER

IS THAT A PROBLEM, ROB?
UH, YEAH... WELL, I JUST
WANTED TO BE IN A CLUB
GET OUT.
WHAT?
THIS ISN'T A DATING SERVICE.
JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

IN NEW BUSINESS, PETER NESSBAUMB
WAS AWARDED A GOLDEN FEATHER BY
UNANIMOUS VOTE FOR SIGHTING
THE LONG-TAILED JAEGER.
MY PROPOSITION TO INVESTIGATE
THE PURCHASE OF A HANG GLIDER
WAS DEFEATED FOUR TO ONE DESPITE
IT BEING AN AWESOME IDEA.
FINALLY CAROLINE HALPERN
THREATENED TO QUIT YBS
IF I DIDN'T STOP CALLING HER

REPORTS, COMMITTEE REPORTS,
AND SPECIAL ORDERS AND PROCEED
DIRECTLY TO NEW BUSINESS.
ALL FOR IT?
YAY.
ALL OPPOSED?
NAH.
THE MOTION PASSES
TWO VOTES TO ONE.
IS THERE ANY NEW BUSINESS?
UH, MR. CHAIRMAN?
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES
DAVID PORTNOY.
I SPOTTED THIS ON THE
STREET THIS MORNING.
I GOT A WEIRD FEELING ABOUT IT.
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ECLIPSE
PLUMAGE WHITE-WING SCOTER.
NUH HUH, LOOK AT THE
WAY THE NAPE
A MOVE TO MARK THE IMAGE AS
INCLUSIVE AND CARRY
ON WITH THE MEETING.
MOVE TO FIND THE BIRD AGAIN.
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES HIMSELF.
MR. PORTNOY, THIS ISN'T THE
FIRST TIME YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO THE COMMITTEE.
FOR REFERENCE, I SET THE
ALLEGED SUNGRY LAST SUMMER.
I DIDN'T HAVE A PICTURE.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THERE'S
A CREDIBILITY GAP HERE.
MR. BARSKY?
WHILE I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT
OF DAVID'S PROPOSAL, A RARE BIRD
SIGHTING CERTAINLY COULD
REVERSE SINKING MEMBERSHIP
BUT IN MY OPINION, I THINK WE
SHOULD STICK TO MORE AGGRESSIVE
RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES.
LIKE GETTING A HANG GLIDER.
THANK YOU. THAT'S
ALL MR. CHAIRMAN.
- ALL FOR FINDING DAVID'S DUCK?
- YAY.
- ALL OPPOSED?
- NAY.

SO I GOT EVERYTHING KIND
OF SORTED OUT INTO
THREE MAIN GROUPS.
SAVE, THROW, CHARITY.
YOU GOT SOMETHING ON
YOUR LIP. WHAT'S THAT?
NOTHING.
A PEN EXPLODED.
WAIT, ARE YOU KIDDING?
WELL I THOUGHT I'D
SAVE THE GOOD ONES.
MOM WORKED REALLY
HARD FOR ALL OF THESE.
OK, WELL, YEAH... I MEAN, OF
COURSE YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING.
OF COURSE WE'LL KEEP THEM.
WHAT'S THIS?
BLENDER?
OH YOU KNOW WHAT? JULIANA'S
GOT A REALLY NICE BLENDER.
I WAS THINKING WE'D JUST
GIVE THAT ONE TO TED.
YEAH, I'D RATHER WE
GAVE JULIANA'S TO TED.
SURE.
LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'll TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO MEET
THIS STRING QUARTET IN LIKE
LITERALLY... TEN MINUTES.
SO WHY DON'T YOU DO THIS?
TAKE THESE, MARK WHAT
YOU WANT TO KEEP.
THE REST WE'LL EITHER CHUCK
OR WE'LL GIVE TO GOODWILL.
ALRIGHT? OK? PROBLEM SOLVED?
FINE.
YEAH?
SEE YA.
YOU'RE THE CAMERA GUY NOW, HUH?
YEAH.
OK, YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR BIRDS, NOT MOM.
BIRDS.
BIRDS, NOT ME.
WHERE THE HELL IS DAVID?
HE'S RIGHT THERE.
NOT COOL, MAN.
SORRY.
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?
WE'RE IN CRISIS MODE HERE.
I'M SORRY.
I THINK I MAY HAVE FOUND
OH WOW,
OK, SO I CHECKED EVERY SCAUR,
SCOTER, EIDER, INCLUDING THE
PALEARCTIC, NEOTROPICAL OPTIONS.
NONE OF THEM ARE A MATCH.
THIS AGAIN?
DID YOU EVEN SLEEP?
OK. SO THEN I THOUGHT MAYBE
IT'S RARER THAN THOSE.
WELL THE CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
DUCKS CONSIST OF THE WEST
INDIAN WHISTLING, THE LAYSAN,
AND THE WHITE-HEADED DUCK.
BUT IT'S NOT ANY OF THOSE.
SO WHAT'S RARER THAN
CRITICALLY ENDANGERED?
I MEAN NOTHING.
AFTER CRITICALLY
ENDANGERED IT GOES EXTINCT.
EXACTLY.
OH MY GOD.
AH DAMNIT.
CAMPTORHYNCHUS LABRADORIUS.
AH, THIS WOULD BE SO HUGE.
IF EVELYN REED KNEW I
REDISCOVERED AN EXTINCT DUCK,
SHE'D DEFINITELY LET ME DO IT.
POSSIBLY DOGGIE STYLE.
IT'S CALLED
RETROCOPULATION, MAN.
THE TERM DOGGIE STYLE IS
OFFENSIVE TO WOMEN AND
POSSIBLY DOGS AS WELL.
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.
GUYS, YOU'RE BOTH
MISSING THE POINT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YEAH, I MEAN IT HAS TO
BE A FEMALE, NOT A MALE.
OOH THE WING MARKS CONCERN
ME, BUT TO BE FAIR,
WING MARKS ALWAYS CONCERN ME.
B TEAMS
HOW DOES THAT WORK?
OK, WE NEED TO FIND
THIS DUCK AGAIN.
OH WHAT WE NEED IS
AN EXPERT OPINION.
WELL, UH, I CAN GET US A
MEETING WITH LAWRENCE CONRAD.
JUST BECAUSE HE SAID YOU HAD
NICE STYLE AT A BOOK SIGNING.
UM, HE SAID I HAD
INTERESTING STYLE, AND YES,
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY. DICK.
HELLO?
HE'S TOO BUSY. I TOLD YOU THIS.
HELLO?
WHAT?
OH SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.
MY SECRETARY'S AT LUNCH AND
THIS THING SHOULD HAVE
THERE YOU GO, ANYONE?
UH, YELLOW WARBLER.
BRAVO. DO COME IN.
NOPE.
NO, NO.
THAT'S ALL WRONG.
YEAH WELL, IT DOES
DECLINE AT THE NAPE.
WHICH ONE OF YOU SAW IT?
UH, I DID.
I'M SORRY THE
PICTURE'S SO BLURRY.
I WAS ON MY BIKE
WHEN I SPOTTED IT.
ON YOUR BIKE?
THAT'S MARVELOUS.
THAT'S THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THIS FIELD.
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A
HIGH SCHOOL KID ON YOUR BIKE,
OR
AN OLD EGG HEAD LIKE ME WITH
A BOAT LOAD OF SILLY DEGREES.
ABSOLUTELY ANYONE
CAN BE A BIRDER.
EXCEPT FOR BLIND PEOPLE I SPOSE.
SO YOU THINK IT COULD
ACTUALLY BE A RARE
CLOSE THE DOOR, PLEASE.
ANY OF YOU FAMILIAR WITH
THE TERM LAZARUS SPECIES?
YOU, GLASSES.
AN ORGANISM REDISCOVERED
ALIVE AFTER HAVING BEEN
CONSIDERED EXTINCT.
AND WHILE LAZARUS SPECIES ARE
VERY RARE, HERE IN AMERICA,
I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF BEING
AMONGST THOSE WHO REFOUND THE
IVORY BILLED WOODPECKER IN 2005,
THOUGH CERTAIN SCIENTISTS
DO DISPUTE MY CLAIM.
FOOLS.
FEBRUARY 20TH, 2005.
I REMEMBER BECAUSE IT WAS
THREE WEEKS AFTER MY LIFE
MAGELLANIC WOODPECKER IN CHILE,
QUITE A MONTH FOR CAMPEPHILUS.
YOU REMEMBER ALL THE
DATES ON YOUR LIFE LIST?
NOW... ON MAY 13TH OF
THIS YEAR, WE MIGHT
I DO STRESS ""MIGHT""
HAVE SPOTTED
YES.
CAMPTORHYNCHUS LABRODORIOUS.
MMHMM.
THE FIRST BIRD TO GO
EXTINCT IN NORTH AMERICA.
NO ONE HAS SEEN ONE OF
THESE FELLAS SINCE 1878.
SO DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT
DAVID SAW A LABRADOR DUCK?
OF COURSE THE PHOTO'S TOO
BLURRY TO PROVE ANYTHING.
AND CERTAINLY OUT OF
CONSIDERATION FOR PUBLICATION.
TRUST ME WHAT BIRDERS DO NOT
NEED IS MORE CONTROVERSY.
NO, I THINK THE ONLY THING TO DO
HERE IS TO FIND THE BIRD AGAIN.
WELL IT'S PROBABLY MIGRATING.
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.
WHICH MEANS YOU NEED
TO GET A MOVE ON.
THE LABRADOR IS CLOSELY RELATED
TO SEA DUCKS. SUCH AS EIDERS.
IT'S PROBABLY HEADING NORTH,
MAYBE EVEN MIGRATING WITH
SCOTERS. NOW THE GOOD NEWS FOR
YOU, IS THAT IT'LL BE ATTRACTED
TO THE LARGEST INLAND BODIES
OF WATER BEFORE IT HITS THE
COAST. NOW MY GUESS IS, IT'LL
BE IN SOUTHERN CONNECTICUT
BY SUN FALL TOMORROW.
SO YOU THINK IT'S ACTUALLY
POSSIBLE TO FIND IT AGAIN?
I DO.
BUT I MUST WARN YOU,
I LOVE THE CHASE.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
YOU'VE READ MY MEMOIR.
""LOOK TO THE SKIES,""
I'VE READ IT FIVE TIMES.
THEN I DON'T NEED TO TELL
YOU THAT I SPENT 15 MONTHS IN
ECUADOR TRACKING THE
PALE-HEADED BRUSH FINCH ONLY TO
LEARN THAT IT WAS A MERE
WHITE-HEADED BRUSH FINCH.
IF I'D FACED FACTS A FEW DAYS
EARLIER, YOU'D BE LOOKING
AT A MAN WITH
TWO LEGS.
I WON'T DENY IT, I'M STARTING
TO GET VERY JEALOUS OF YOU LADS.
WE HAVE, UM, MODERN EUROPEAN
HISTORY CLASS IN 25 MINUTES.
FAIR ENOUGH.
WELL DO KEEP ME INFORMED.
NEVER HESITATE TO CALL.
OH, AND ONE PIECE OF ADVICE
FROM AN OLD TWITCHER,
GET YOURSELVES A BETTER CAMERA.
ONE WITH A SMALL TELEPHOTO LENS.
YEAH, I CAN DEFINITELY DO THAT.
EXCELLENT.
HAVING THE WRONG GEAR IS
PRECISELY WHY THIS PHOTO
IS ULTIMATELY USELESS.
GOOD LUCK, GENTLEMAN.
DR. CONRAD.
DR. CONRAD?
COULD YOU, UM, SIGN MY BOOK?
FIRST EDITION.
YEAH.
PORTNOY.
WAS YOUR MOTHER DOROTHY PORTNOY?
YOU KNOW MY MOTHER?
OF COURSE.
BACK IN THE 80S AND 90S, SHE
HELPED PIONEER THE USE OF
MARINE RADAR TO PREDICT
MIGRATANT FALL OUT.
SHE WAS A REAL UNSUNG
HERO OF BIRDING.
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AWFUL.
I'M DEEPLY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
WHY?
IT'S WAY TOO INTENSE.
I MEAN, I'M SORRY BUT THIS
WOULD AN OFFICIAL YBS MEETING.
OK, MOVE TO DISCUSS.
UM, SECOND.
ALRIGHT, THE CHAIR
RECOGNIZES TIMOTHY BARSKY.
THANK YOU.
CHAIRMAN, MR. PORTNQY, SIMPLY
PUT, WE MUST FIND THIS BIRD.
I THINK IT COULD REPRESENT A NEW
HOPE FOR YBS, WHICH FRANKLY IS
ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE.
I THINK WITH THE RIGHT
PUBLICITY, SIGHTING OF THE
LABRADOR DUCK COULD BOOST
MEMBERSHIP, AND THE THREE OF US
COULD REAP UNTOLD REWARDS.
FAME-WISE, MONEY-WISE,
AND VAGINA-WISE.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S ALL, MR. CHAIRMAN.
I CONCUR. MOVE TO VOTE.
SECOND.
ALL IN FAVOR OF SEARCHING FOR
THE EXTINCT LABRADOR DUCK?
YAY.
ALL OPPOSED. NAY.
MOTION PASSES TWO TO ONE.
I'll DROP THE BUDGET.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
I WANT TO.
YEAH?
HEY, UH... I LEFT SOMETHING
IN THE LAB YESTERDAY.
OH, OK.
I'M ELLEN, BY THE WAY.
WHAT?
WE'RE IN A CLASS TOGETHER,
SO I'M TELLING YOU WHO I AM.
OH.
HI.
HI, THERE YOU GO.
ALRIGHT, SO GIVEN THE EXPECTED
SPEED OF THE LABRADOR DUCK,
IN ITS PRESUMED TRAJECTORY,
THE BIRD WILL BE FORCED
TO REST IN ITS FIFTEEN MILE
RADIUS ENCOMPASSING
CEDAR LAKE OR COCKAPONSET.
OK, WELL I'M PUTTING MY
MONEY ON COCKAPONSET.
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE IT
HAS THE WORD COCK IN IT.
WELL, I STILL MAINTAIN IT'S A
LONGSHOT AT BEST, BUT AS PLACES
GO, YOU KNOW? IT'S MORE
LIKELY THAN MOST.
OH, ON THE TRANSPORTATION
FRONT, MY COUSIN ERIC SAID
HE'D LOAN ME SOME WHEELS.
HE DID?
YEAH. HE'S A COOL GUY.
HE LIKES ME A LOT.
HEY, ISN'T YOUR DAD GETTING
MARRIED THIS WEEKEND?
YEP. THIS IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT.
DAVID?
YEAH.
DAVID. OH HI BOYS.
HELLO MRS. SANTOS.
JULIANA! OW.
DAVID, THERE IS SOMEBODY
HERE TO SEE YOU.
A GIRL FROM YOUR
SCHOOL, I THINK.
GO ON IN, HON.
THANK YOU.
YOU STOLE YOU THE LENS.
PREPOSTEROUS.
WHAT'S PROJECT ANUS?
ANAS, OK? AND IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.
JUST GIVE ME THE LENS.
AND WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU
HAVE OF THIS ALLEGED THEFT
OF THIS ALLEGED LENS?
WELL, IT WAS THERE
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.
I GAVE HIM THE KEYS,
HE WENT INTO THE LAB,
AND THEN IT WAS GONE.
CIRCUMSTANTIAL.
IT'S SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.
OH DAMNIT, PETER.
OH MY GOD.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF A LABRADOR DUCK?
I STILL DON'T GET WHY
IT'S CALLED PROJECT ANUS.
ANAS.
IT'S LATIN FOR DUCK.
YOU GUYS SPEAK LATIN?
YEAH, SOMETIMES.
YOU SHOULD COME WITH US.
THIS WOULD SERIOUSLY WOULD
BE THE FIRST PHOTO OF
THIS EXTINCT DUCK?
YEAH. DEFINITELY.
IF I COME I'M
TAKING THE PICTURE.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
OK, THAT'S NOT A POSSIBILITY.
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.
WE'LL TAKE IT.
WHEN DO WE LEAVE?
âª AM FROM TIMMY'S
COUSIN'S HOUSE.
25 SOUTH RIDGE DRIVE.
COOL.
WHERE THE HELL DID
THAT COME FROM?
SHE MADE ME NERVOUS, OK?
OK, WELL ON THE FLIP SIDE, ONE
OR POSSIBLY MORE OF US WILL GET
SOME ACTION THIS WEEKEND.
MOST LIKELY BEING ME.
NOPE, NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
HEY, NEED SOME HELP?
I GOT IT.
WHERE YOU GOING?
TIMMY'S.
SLEEPING OVER TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING MARRIED.
TOMORROW.
I'll BE BACK IN PLENTY OF TIME.
C'MON DAD, IT'S IMPORTANT.
I GOTTA GO.
ALRIGHT. OK, OK.
I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED TO GIVE
YOU YOUR GRIEVING SPACE.
DON'T DR. SCHULTZ
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, THE
REHEARSAL IS AT 10 AM.
THE REHEARSAL?
YEAH.
IT'S WALKING FROM ONE SIDE OF
THE LAWN TO THE OTHER, RIGHT?
OK, C'MON. TIME OUT.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I GET THAT IT'S ALL GOTTA
SEEM PRETTY WEIRD TO YOU,
AND MAYBE JULIANA'S NOT YOUR
FAVORITE PERSON IN THE WORLD
DAD, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.
FAST FORWARD TEN YEARS FROM
NOW, SHE'S GONNA REALLY CARE,
SHE'S GONNA BE A REALLY COOL,
KICKASS MOM.I MEAN, YOU GOTTA
LOOK AT THINGS, LIKE...
EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON
WHAT?
FOR A REASON?
YOU KNOW, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID THAT.
THAT'S NOT-THAT'S NOT WHAT
I MEANT TO SAY.
WHAT I MEANT
BULLSHIT.
C'MON, DAVID.
YOU ARE TOO FAST.
I GOTCHYA.
SORRY, I'M LATE.
HAVE WE CONFIRMED HE
KNOWS WE'RE COMING?
YES.
ERIC?
TIMMY.
MY MAN.
ERIC.
MY MAN.
UM, DO YOU THINK WE COULD
GRAB THOSE KEYS NOW?
OH YEAH, KEYS.
TOTALLY.
COULD YOU GO GET THEM NOW?
SURE.
YOU'RE ERIC'S COUSIN?
YEAH, FIRST COUSIN.
THESE ARE KEYS ARE KEYS
TO A KRYPTONITE BIKE LOCK.
WAIT, YOU WANTED
TO BORROW MY CAR?
YEAH.
TIMMY, I'M NOT GOING
TO LEND YOU MY CAR.
WHY NOT?
FOR LIKE SEVERAL REASONS.
THERE ARE INSURANCE ISSUES THAT
WOULD NOT BE EASY TO RESOLVE,
TO SAY THE LEAST.
I HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT
YOU OR ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE
SAFE AND/OR RELIABLE DRIVERS.
NOT TO MENTION, TRISH AND I HAVE
PLANS TO USE THE CAR TO GO UP TO
SHEEP'S MEADOW TO HANG
OUT AND SMOKE WEED.
WELL HE DOES MAKE SOME
CONVINCING ARGUMENTS.
THANK YOU.
FINE, WELL THANKS ANYWAY, ERIC.
YOU'RE A REAL COOL GUY.
PS, GRANDMA THINKS
YOU'RE A COMMUNIST.
I AM A COMMUNIST.
BYE TIMMY'S LITTLE FRIENDS.
BYE.
I HATE HIM.
HE HADN'T DJED MY BARMITZVAH,
MY LIFE WOULD BE
A LOT BETTER RIGHT NOW.
BELIEVE YOU ME.
SO IS TRISH ERIC'S
STEADY GIRLFRIEND?
WHAT?
OH, FOUND IT.
EVER DRIVE A CABRIOLET, PETER?
ABSOLUTLEY NOT.
WHAT? YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE WITH A LICENSE.
I'M NOT DRIVING A
STOLEN CAR, GUYS.
IT'S NOT A STOLEN CAR.
WE'LL BRING IT BACK TOMORROW,
HE'LL JUST THINK HE FORGOT
WHERE HE PARKED IT. RIGHT?
COME ON, MAN.
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO
NOT BE A TOTAL PUSSY.
YOU CAN IMPRESS AN ACTUAL GIRL.
IT'S EXCITING.
ELLEN?
I THINK PETER SHOULD
DO WHAT HE WANTS.
BUT YEAH, I WOULD BE IMPRESSED.
VERY IMPRESSED.
THANKS.
PETER, JUST MERGE.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
KIND OF PRESSURE THIS IS.
NO IDEA.
K, WELL YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPAZZ.
YOU'RE GOING TO
KEEP IT UNDER 357
YES, I AM.
PROBABLY MORE DANGEROUS
TIMMY?
HOLY SHIT.
WHAT IS THIS? IS THAT
CRACK COCAINE?
I HAVE NO IDEA. MAYBE.
MAYBE?
JUST KEEP DRIVING PETER.
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT LOOKS LIKE CRYSTALS.
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE
IT'S ROCK CANDY.
ELLEN, GROW UP. OK?
THEY'RE CRYSTALS.
OH SHIT.
WHAT?
CRYSTAL METH.
THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW.
WHAT?
NO, WE CAN'T JUST THROW
IT OUT THE WINDOW.
YES, WE CAN.
NO, PETER, THINK.
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE RETURN THE
CAR WITHOUT THE DRUGS, OK?
LIKE MAYBE ERIC WAS TRYING TO
SELL THEM ON BEHALF OF SOME DRUG
LORDS, AND THEN THE DRUG LORDS
COME LOOKING FOR THE MONEY,
SUDDENLY ERIC DOESN'T HAVE
THE MONEY OR THE DRUGS.
SO THEY KILL HIM.
OK?
ERIC SUCKS BUT HE
DOESN'T DESERVE TO DIE.
OK, JUST KEEP IT HIDDEN.
GIVE IT, ELLEN.
DONE.
I DON'T LIKE IT.
I'M SHOCKED. I'M REALLY SHOCKED.
PETER, FOR THE LOVE OF
GOD, YOU HAVE TO SPEED UP.
IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN A WAGON.
NOW WE'RE CRUISING.
THIS IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL.
PETER, IT'S FINE.
YOU ONLY HAVE YOUR
LEARNERS PERMIT.
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?
SOUNDS LIKE BLACK
AND WHITE WARBLER.
IT SOUNDS LIKE A
RED BREASTED NUT HATCH
BUT IT'S COMING FROM THE ENGINE.
WHAT'S A FINCH LOOK LIKE?
A FINCH, IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A PERCHING BIRD WITH A
SMALL, SHARP, POINTY BILL.
COOL, MY BOYFRIEND'S BAND
IS CALLED THE REAL FINCHES.
THE REAL FINCHES?
HUH, SOUNDS LIKE A
REAL HARDCORE BAND.
RIGHT, 'CUZ YOU'RE INTO
MORE HARDCORE STUFF
LIKE BEETHOVEN.
UMM BARTOK, OK?
MAYBE LIKE LATE BEETHOVEN, YEAH.
RIGHT.
THESE ARE TOTALLY RETRO.
OH YEAH, THANKS.
THEY'RE MY MOM'S.
IS SHE A BIG BIRDER?
YOU KNOW HIS MOM IS DEAD, RIGHT?
WHAT?
OH, I GUESS IT WAS
BEFORE YOU MOVED HERE.
YEAH, DAVE DOESN'T
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT.
THANKS, TIMMY.
OK, GUYS I HAVE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.
I WANT EVERYONE TO REMAIN
STILL WHILE I TALK,
ESPECIALLY YOU, PETER.
THERE'S A VEHICLE THAT'S BEEN
TRAILING US FOR THE PAST
TEN MILES, AND THERE ARE
DEFINITELY GUNS IN THE VEHICLE.
OH MY GOD.
PETER, STAY STILL.
SORRY.
THEY COULD BE ERIC'S
DRUG LORD BOSSES.
DAVID, CAN YOU JUST SLOW
DOWN AND SEE IF THEY PASS US?
YEAH.
IT DOESN'T HAVE GUNS ON IT.
OH SHIT.
THERE THEY ARE.
AHH THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.
HOW WAS THAT A CLOSE ONE?
IT WAS A CLOSE ONE.
HEY WHAT'S WITH ALL THE PEOPLE?
IS THIS LIKE AN IMPORTANT
DAY FOR BIRDING OR SOMETHING?
IT'S SATURDAY.
HEY, PORTNOY'S BACK.
HEY THEENY.
ARE YOU LIKE THE BOY WONDER OF
THE BIRDING WORLD OR SOMETHING?
NO. I JUST HAVEN'T
BEEN HERE IN AWHILE.
SO, WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE EXACTLY?
OK.
UM... FIRST YOU HAVE THE FEEDER
FILLERS, AND THEY JUST WANT A
BIRD FEEDER SO THAT THEY CAN
ATTRACT A BIRD LIKE A CARDINAL.
AND THEN THERE'S LISTERS,
LIKE THOSE GUYS OVER THERE.
NOW LISTERS, THEY LIKE
THE NUMBERS, THE DATA
SO THEY RECORD EVERYTHING ON
THESE VERY METICULOUS LIFE LISTS
SO IF MY DAD WAS A
BIRDER, HE'D BE A LISTER.
HE'S NOT A BIRDER?
NO.
HE OWNS FIVE CHICKEN HUTS.
HE LITERALLY MAKES A
LIVING KILLING BIRDS.
SO WHICH KIND OF BIRDER ARE YOU?
WELL THERE'S ONE MORE.
THE WATCHERS.
NOW, THE WATCHERS, THIS IS
LAWRENCE CONRAD'S DEFINITION,
UH... THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE A
TRANSCENDENT CONNECTION BETWEEN
NATURE THAT ERASES ANY
DISTINCTION BETWEEN, I GUESS,
HUMAN AND BIRDS' SOULS.
LET ME GUESS, YOU'RE A WATCHER.
WELL, THERE'S ACTUALLY VERY
FEW WATCHERS OUT THERE.
UM, LAWRENCE CONRAD SAYS THAT
IN THE WORLD OF BIRDING,
MOST OF US ARE JUST LISTERS
WHO STRIVE TO BE WATCHERS.
WHAT IS THAT?
OLD SCHOOL DUCK CALL.
HELP US IN FINDING THE
UH... THE YOU KNOW WHAT.
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT?
NOTHING.
YOU GUYS HEADING OUT?
YEAH, WE'RE GOING
TO COCKAPONSET.
THE COCK.
YOU GUYS FROM AROUND HERE?
NO. SUMWORTH.
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU SEE UP THERE?
UH, HOODED WARBLERS, ACADIAN
FLYCATCHER, YELLOW-BILLED
CUCKOO, YELLOW-WINGED VERIO,
THIS ONE TIME I SAW
WAIT, YOU SAW A YELLOW-
WINGED VERIO IN NEW YORK?
YEAH.
WOW, WOW, WOW.
DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE, JEFF.
WHAT?
OH, I'M SORRY. I MEAN
A YELLOW-THROATED VERIO.
THERE YOU GO.
YEAH.
THERE IT IS.
SO, WHAT KIND OF STUFF
DO YOU GUYS SEE?
WE JUST HAD A GREAT
TRIP TO TANZANIA.
SAW AN USAMBARA EAGLE
OWL, AMONG OTHER THINGS.
NOT BAD FOR OUR FIRST YEAR.
FIRST YEAR? LAST
YEAR WE CLIMBED
THE SEVEN SUMMITS,
THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING FOR
THE WORLD BIG YEAR RECORD.
OH, SO YOU'RE NOT BIRDERS.
YOU'RE MORE LIKE
MOUNTAIN DEW ADS.
MORE LIKE EXTREME HOBBYISTS.
IT MEANS IN TEN MONTHS, WE'VE
SEEN OVER 315 ENDANGERED SPECIES
INCLUDING FINDING ONLY
THE SIXTH KNOWN NEST OF
A GRAUER'S BROADBILL.
THAT'S AMAZING.
YEAH.
DAVID SAW A LABRADOR DUCK.
YOU KNOW THAT'S EXTINCT, RIGHT?
YES. WELL MAYBE IT'S
NOT EXTINCT ANY MORE
NO, NO, SHE IS-SHE
IS NOT A BIRDER.
SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.
YES, I DO.
NO, SHE DOESN'T.
OK. BECAUSE THAT-THAT IS A
PRETTY BIG CLAIM, YOU KNOW?
SPOTTING AN EXTINCT SPECIES.
DO YOU GUYS HAVE A
PHOTO OR ANYTHING?
NO. SHE'S CONFUSED.
WE CAN'T HAVE A PICTURE OF
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST.
RIGHT.
WE SHOULD BE GOING.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
WELL, GOOD BIRDING.
GOOD BIRDING FELLAS.
GOOD BIRDING.
I'M SORRY, ELLEN.
YOU'RE A COMPLETE IDIOT.
WHATEVER.
THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ME ANYWAY.
LET'S HOPE TO GOD YOU'RE RIGHT.
âªâª
HEY, CHECK IT OUT.
DAVID?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
JUST GONNA CATCH UP WITH THEM.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
THERE WE GO.
COULD THE LABRADOR
DUCK BE UP THERE?
NO, NO. THEY'RE CANADA GEESE.
âªâª
SHIT.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
DAMNIT. WHAT'S HAPPENING?
IT MUST BE RELATED TO THE
WARBLER NOISE. SHIT.
THE NUTHATCH NOISE.
OK, SHUT UP PETER.
I THINK IT'S JUST AN
OVERHEATED ALTERNATOR THING.
OR SOMETHING.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WE SHOULD GO HOME.
I KNEW IT.
I'M SORRY. YOU KNEW WHAT?
COME ON.
LOOK, WE ALL KNEW FROM
THE START IT WAS A MISTAKE
TO BRING YOU, OK?
YOU WERE LATE, YOU HAVE
TO PEE ALL THE TIME,
AND NOW YOU WANT TO QUIT.
I BROUGHT A TELEPHOTO
LENS AND FIVE YEARS OF
PHOTOGRAPHY EXPERIENCE.
WHAT DID YOU BRING?
OH, LET ME THINK. EXCELLENT
LEADERSHIP SKILLS, LOGIC
AN ORANGE BELT
OK? FLUENCY IN LATIN
AND ESPANOL
AWESOME LOGIC SKILLS.
YOU SAID THAT ALREADY.
GUYS, I'M GOING TO
GO CALL TRIPLE A.
OK, WHERE ARE WE EXACTLY?
UM, WE'RE SOMEWHERE
NEAR WOODSTOCK.
WAIT, WOODSTOCK?
YEAH.
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO CALL?
BOOTY CALL.
THE REED'S HAVE
A HOUSE OUT HERE.
WAIT, EVELYN REED?
YEAH.
HEY, EVELYN.
IT'S TIMMY.
TIMMY.
TIMMY BARSKY.
TIMMY B
WE SHOULD GET A BACKUP.
NO, THEY'RE FRIENDS... KIND OF.
I MEAN, I GUESS SHE DOES CALL
HIM HER PERSONAL MATH HOBBIT.
SO WE'RE IN A BIT
OF A PICKLED DICK.
NAH, JUST A STUPID LINE FROM
UM, I GUESS YOU WANNA
PROBABLY CALL YOUR MOM.
THAT WOULD INVOLVE TELLING HER
WHERE I AM, SO NO THANK YOU.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW?
SHE'S IN NEW MEXICO AT A SWING
AND SALSA CONFERENCE THIS
WEEKEND, SO IT WAS EITHER THIS,
OR SITTING AROUND ON MY OWN.
SO, SWING AND SALSA?
WELL THEY'RE ACTUALLY
REALLY DIFFERENT.
OK.
OH, THAT'S-THAT'S A LOT.
HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR MOM.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
BRING IT UP AND
THAT'S OK. TIMMY'S
AN IDIOT SOMETIMES.
IT'S REALLY, IT'S
NOT A BIG DEAL.
I MEAN, OF COURSE IT'S A BIG
DEAL, BUT IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
HOW LONG AGO DID SHE PASS AWAY?
ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.
JUST YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE MY
HEY GUYS.
WE'RE GOOD.
SO, WHAT IS THIS TOP SECRET
MISSION YOU GUYS ARE ON?
I MEAN, I COULD TELL YOU BUT
YOU'D HAVE TO KILL ME?
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I'M A PACIFIST.
PETER WOULD KILL YOU.
I'M A PACIFIST.
HE'S REALLY NOT.
HE HAS TO SAY THAT.
IT'S HIS COVER.
OH MY GOD, YOU'RE SO FUNNY.
HAHA I KNOW. YOU KNOW? I
THINK WE MAY HAVE ACTUALLY
FOUND AN EXTINCT DUCK.
WOW.
OH THIS IS PUBLIC
INFORMATION NOW?
UH YEAH. GET IN THE CAR.
THANKS AGAIN, EV.
HEY, I SHOULD BE THANKING YOU.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I
WOULD DO WITHOUT YOU.
HEY, YOU KNOW, I'M TIMMY.
YOU ARE.
BYE, GUYS.
OH, AND GIRL.
WHY WAS SHE THANKING YOU?
OH MY GOD, SHE'S SO HOT.
HOW MUCH THIS TIME, TIMMY?
OH I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE
THE REST OF THE YEAR
YOU'RE DOING HER MATH HOMEWORK
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR?
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND
OUR RELATIONSHIP, OK?
OH MY GOD.
WHAT?
NO GUNS.
WHAT?
THEY'VE TAKEN THE GUNS.
YOU BROUGHT IT WITH YOU?
WE NEED TO CALL THE COPS.
LIKE RIGHT NOW GUYS.
AND TELL THEM WHAT, PETER?
THAT WE STOLE A CAR
LOADED WITH NARCOTICS?
YOU ARE A GENIUS.
KEEP IT HIDDEN.
ALL IN FAVOR?
AYE.
YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY'LL
KILL US IN THE WOODS, OK?
ERIC.
WE HAVE A SITUATION.
WHAT'S THAT ONE?
UH... BLACK CAP CHICKADEE.
HOW CAN YOU TELL WHICH
ONE IT IS SO QUICKLY?
WELL, THE BEST WAY
TO RECOGNIZE IS JIZZ?
WHAT?
G-I-âª-âª.
GENERAL, IMPRESSION,
SHAPE, AND SIZE.
THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE A
SNAP IDEA OF A BIRD.
YEAH, I MEAN, I GUESS
IT HAD A NICE JIZZ.
YOU KNOW, I KNOW JIZZ
SOUNDS LIKE EJACULATION
COME ON.
CHICKADEE JIZZ.
YEAH, IT'S IN THE
TIT FAMILY TOO.
UM, I GUESS ANOTHER WAY IS YOU
CAN ID IT BY ITS CALLS, SO...
UH, DOWNY WOODPECKER.
WHITE BREASTED NUTHATCH.
CAROLINA WREN.
THE NUTHATCH AGAIN.
WHAT WAS THAT ONE?
WOOD THRESH.
HOLD ON.
YEAH?
WHERE ARE YOU?
TIMMY'S.
YOU DROVE TO TIMMY'S
IN ERIC'S CAR?
PETER DROVE.
DAVID.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
WE MAY HAVE DISCOVERED
AN EXTINCT DUCK.
WE'RE AT A PARK IN CONNECTICUT
JUST TRYING TO LOOK FOR IT AND
WE'LL BE BACK BY TOMORROW.
AN EXTINCT DUCK?
YES, WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO TRACK IT
ALRIGHT, FIRST, YOU'RE
SERIOUSLY GROUNDED.
SECOND, AND LET ME MAKE THIS
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR, IF WE ALL END
UP WAITING AROUND FOR YOU
TOMORROW JUST TO WALTZ IN
YOU'VE ALREADY MADE IT
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR HOW YOU
CAN'T HANDLE WAITING.
YOU KNOW WHAT, DON'T COME.
DAD.
DAD, I'M SORRY.
NO, NO.
YOU'RE A YOUNG MAN NOW.
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS.
I'll HAVE TED BE THE BEST MAN.
SURE.
FINE.
THAT WAS YOUR DAD?
YES.
HEY, EVERYTHING OK?
YES.
ARE YOU SURE?
MY DAD'S GETTING
MARRIED TOMORROW.
TO MY MOM'S NURSE.
DO YOU WANT-DO YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
NO.
WA-WAIT DAVID, HOW ARE
WE GONNA GET BACK IN TIME?
WE'RE NOT.
âªâª
JUST SAYING.
IS THE SLUTTIEST BIRD.
WHY?
HE OR SHE HAS A
PARTNER THEN IMMEDIATELY
GOES TO ANOTHER PARTNER,
KIND OF LIKE YOU, ELLEN.
THANK YOU, TIMMY THANK YOU.
IT'S RIGHT THERE
BEHIND THE BUSH.
ONE O'CLOCK. ONE O'CLOCK.
YOU GOTTA LOOK RIGHT AT IT,
THEN JUST PUT THE BINOCULARS
IT'S LIKE I'M TALKING
TO IT AND IT REPLIES.
PSH PSH.
PETER, SHUT UP.
OH, BIG SPIDER, BIG SPIDER.
THERE IT IS.
ALRIGHT, SO THERE'S A BRIDGE
ABOUT 2 MILES NORTHEAST OF HERE.
IF IT'S GETTING DARK, I THINK
WE SHOULD JUST START HERE.
EXACTLY.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS,
I'M CROSSING THIS RIVER.
IT'S WAY TOO DANGEROUS.
OH C'MON PETER.
YOU KNOW WOMEN CITE PHYSICAL
BRAVERY AS THE NUMBER ONE
QUALITY IN A MAN?
A SENSE OF HUMOR.
ELLEN, BRAVE OR FUNNY GUYS?
FUNNY.
WHAT?
OK, WELL WHATEVER.
WITH HOT WOMEN ANYWAY, AS IN
EVELYN REED, IT'S PHYSICAL
BRAVERY SO HAH.
CAN WE STOP WITH THE
EVELYN REED ALREADY?
UM, JEALOUS MUCH?
TIMMY, YOU KEEP KISSING HER ASS,
HOPING SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN.
WHICH IT WILL.
WHEN SHE'S SO CLEARLY
DORK BAITING YOU.
OK, EVELYN REED
LIKES ME ALRIGHT?
WHAT'S DORK BAITING?
IT'S WHEN A CUTE GIRL IS
SUPER NICE TO A NERDY GUY
I'M NOT NERDY.
SO THAT HE'LL WORSHIP HER AND
FIX HER COMPUTER AND MAKE HER
FEEL GOOD ABOUT HERSELF AND,
OH, ALSO DO HER HOMEWORK.
HEY, I'M DOING HER HOMEWORK
BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS, ALRIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS
DO FOR EACH OTHER.
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW BECAUSE
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.
TIMMY, IT TOOK HER FORTY-FIVE
MINUTES TO DRIVE US HERE.
SO, NOW YOU'RE GOING TO
GO AND DO HER HOMEWORK
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.
DOESN'T THAT SOUND
MESSED UP, TO YOU?
LET'S JUST GO.
SHE CALLS YOU HER
PERSONAL MATH HOBBIT.
AH, THAT'S BULLSHIT. I'M
NOT GONNA BELIEVE THAT.
YEAH? DAVID TOLD ME.
WHAT?
IS THAT TRUE?
I'M SORRY.
SHUT UP!
IS THAT TRUE?
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY IT
JUST PLEASE STOP TALKING! WHY
ARE YOU SUCH A BITCH TO ME?
LET'S GO, TIMMY.
NO, I KNOW. YOU TAKE HER SIDE.
I'M NOT TAKING ANYONE'S SIDE.
OF COURSE YOU ARE. YOU DON'T
GIVE A CRAP ABOUT ME OR PETER.
COME ON. LET'S JUST
CROSS THE RIVER, OK GUYS?
STOP BEING A PUSSY.
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD
IS FULL OF SHIT, OK?
HE DOESN'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT
YOU, ME, OR FINDING THE
LABRADOR DUCK. HE JUST WANTS TO
PORK ELLEN OF TROY OVER THERE.
I AM NOT
A PUSSY, OK?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
EVERY TIME I LOOK AT YOU,
YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK TO HER,
AND FEEL HER UP.
DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP, DAVE.
SHE'S PROBABLY JUST
DORK BAITING YOU.
I DON'T EVEN LIKE ELLEN.
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.
OH YEAH, I WOULDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT MY BEST FRIEND.
BECAUSE HIS MOM DIED HE'S
ALL MESSED UP, OR WHATEVER.
FUCK YOU!
ARE YOU OK?
PETER, ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
HIS INHALER!
SHIT, OK. STOP, STOP, STOP.
PETER, STAND UP!
STAND UP, COME ON.
COME ON, COME ON.
WE GOTTA GET HIM TO SHORE.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
THIS WAY, THIS WAY.
OH MY GOD, IT'S SO COLD.
GUYS, IT'S SOUNDING REALLY BAD.
OK, OK. LAY DOWN. LAY DOWN.
I'M JUST GONNA GIVE
YOU MOUTH TO MOUTH, OK?
LEAN BACK, LEAN BACK.
STOP, OK READY? 1, 2, 3.
I GOT IT!
I FOUND IT.
THROW IT TO ME.
TIMMY, JUST THROW IT.
OH SHIT, OK.
THROW IT!
OH GOD.
WHAT THE HELL TIMMY?
ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL HIM?
I'M SORRY, I'M A MURDERER.
I GOT IT.
PETER.
THAT SUCKED.
YOU ALRIGHT?
YOU OK?
THANKS AGAIN FOR THE âª-SHIRT.
IT'S A GOOD COLOR FOR YOU.
IT REALLY IS.
SO HOW LONG-?
SHH.
GREAT HORNED OWL.
NICE.
PERSONAL FRICKIN HOBBIT.
THERE'RE TONS OF GIRLS
OUT THERE, TIMMY.
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY, ""MS. I HAVE
CRAZY WILD SEX WHENEVER I WANT.""
WHAT?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
RUB IT IN OUR FACES.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'VE NEVER EVEN HAD SEX, OK?
THAT'S BULLSHIT. YOU'RE
DATING A GUY IN A BAND.
WE'VE ONLY KISSED, AND HE
LIVES IN MINNESOTA ANYWAY.
IS THAT WHERE YOU'RE FROM?
I LIVED THERE FOR A YEAR.
THEN BEFORE THAT DELAWARE,
TEXAS, GUAM, AND
GERMANY?
GERMANY, YEAH.
MY DAD'S IN THE AIRFORCE.
THAT'S SO BADASS.
IT SUCKS.
I'M ALWAYS THE NEW GIRL, AND
THEN WHENEVER I MAKE A FRIEND,
WE MOVE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING NEXT?
ACTUALLY IT LOOKS LIKE WE'LL
BE IN SUMWORTH FOR GOOD NOW.
OK, WELL
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.
UM
TECHNICALLY SPEAKING I'VE
NEVER REALLY DONE A GIRL,
NOT EVEN MISSIONARY STYLE.
YOU'RE FIFTEEN.
IT'S OK. IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
I MEAN, I'VE ONLY
KISSED LIKE ONE BOY.
OK, WELL I HAVE ANOTHER
CONFESSION TO MAKE.
UM
TECHNICALLY SPEAKING I'VE
NEVER REALLY KISSED A GIRL.
ME NEITHER.
SPIN THE STICK?
RIGHT.
I'VE, UM
I'VE NEVER REALLY
KISSED A GIRL EITHER.
NO?
I'M SORRY.
DON'T PATRONIZE ME.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
THAT STORY DOES NOT
GET BETTER WITH AGE
UNLIKE THIS WINE.
THANK YOU. NOT FROM A BOX.
OK, SO YOU BRIBED A COP?
I INVENTED A GREAT MEAL,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT'S DEBATABLE.
WAIT, FRENCH FRIES WITH HONEY
IS NOT THAT GREAT A MEAL.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S PAYING FOR DAVID'S
COLLEGE SO I'M NOT COMPLAINING.
WHERE IS DAVID ANYWAY?
HE'S UH
HE'S ACTUALLY ON A
BIRD WATCHING TRIP.
I DON'T KNOW HE WAS
STILL IN TO ALL THAT.
OH YEAH, DEFINITELY INTO IT.
THAT'S GREAT.
IS HE STILL PLANNING ON
SKIPPING COLLEGE AND
MAKING WILDLIFE FILMS?
WHAT?
WHEN DID HE TELL YOU THAT, TED?
I DON'T KNOW.
THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM.
AT THE FUNERAL.
AHH.
NO, I GUESS WE HAVEN'T
TALKED ABOUT IT.
ALRIGHT, WOULD YOU
LIKE SOME MORE WINE?
YES.
OF COURSE.
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
HEY PETER?
YEAH?
YOU EVER WISH THAT EARTH
WAS MORE LIKE MIDDLE EARTH?
ALL THE TIME.
DRUG LORDS.
I'll STAND GUARD.
YES.
I CAN SEE YOU.
JESUS!
CLOSE YOUR EYES, ALRIGHT?
SORRY.
DONE.
SORRY.
CAN I SEE?
SURE.
THERE IT IS.
FIRST DRAWING?
YEAH.
REALLY TRYING TO
PERFECT THAT ONE, HUH?
YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.
IT'S FINE.
LAST YEAR I CAME HOME
EARLY FROM SCHOOL ONE TIME
AND MY DAD WAS DOING DRUGS.
WAIT
LIKE DRUG-DRUGS?
YEAH.
LIKE SNORTING CRUSHED OXYCONTIN.
IT WAS PRETTY INTENSE.
I HAVE THIS IMAGE STUCK IN MY
HEAD OF HIS FACE WHEN HE SAW ME.
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE
EXCEPT FOR MY SHRINK.
HAVE A SHRINK TOO.
YEAH, I WOULD HOPE SO.
YOU'RE DAD'S GETTING MARRIED
IN LIKE TWENTY HOURS.
ARE YOU SAD HE'S MARRYING
YOUR MOM'S NURSE?
YEAH.
WAS THERE?
FORGET IT SORRY
OVERLAP?
YEAH.
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.
I'M SURE THAT THERE WASN'T
MY MOM WAS SICK FOR A LONG TIME.
I'VE DEFINITELY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ACTUALLY
A LOT EASIER TO TALK TO
THAN MY SHRINK.
AND DEFINITELY A LOT EASIER TO
TALK TO THEN TIMMY AND PETER.
THANKS.
I DON'T REALLY HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
HE WAS JUST A GUY THAT I
KISSED AT A PARTY, AND I SAID
HE WAS MY BOYFRIEND, BUT
HE'S NOT.
OK.
YEAH, SO
I SHOULD GO BACK TO BED.
OK. I GUESS I'll
GUARD... SIT, GUARD.
RIGHT, OK.
YEAH.
- ALRIGHT, WELL GOOD NIGHT.
- NIGHT
SHHH.
WHAT WAS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
TIMMY?
GOD DAMN DRUG LORDS.
WAIT UP.
TIMMY.
IT'S GO TIME.
WAIT, WAIT, YOUR PLAN
IS TO KNIFE THEM?
JUST PUT AWAY THE KNIFE TIMMY.
IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.
WOAH.
NICE OUTFITS.
HOW WE DOING?
ANY LUCK FINDING THE LABRADOR?
WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING US?
WE'RE ACTUALLY
FOLLOWING OUR GUIDE.
WHO'S YOUR GUIDE?
GENTLEMEN.
BIRDING ON AN ATV.
SEEMS LIKE AN OXYMORON,
BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONE.
YOU KNOW?
EVER SINCE YOU BOYS
LEFT MY OFFICE,
I'VE BEEN KICKING MYSELF.
HOW COULD I, A NOTED VETERAN
OF THE FIELD, ENTRUST
WHAT IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST
ORNITHILOGICAL FIND
OF THE CENTURY, TO, NO
OFFENSE NOW, AMATEURS.
LATELY I'VE BEEN SPENDING A BIT
OF TIME GUIDING THESE GENTLEMEN
HERE, AND I JUST THOUGHT THE
MORE CHAPS HELPING OUT
YEAH, WE DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.
WELL I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE
THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
HERE IS FINDING THE BIRD.
WE'RE SIMPLY DOUBLING THE
SIZE OF OUR SEARCH PARTY.
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO, EVEN WITH
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COMBING THE
ARKANSAS BAYOU, WE STILL
COULDN'T PROVE OUR CLAIM.
YEAH, WE KNOW. THE
IVORY-BILLED WOODPECKER.
WE'RE FANS.
YOU'RE TRYING TO
POACH OUR SIGHTING.
WHO'S THE NEW GIRL?
HER NAME'S ELLEN.
GUYS, I'M SORRY.
CAN WE TAKE A SECOND?
OF COURSE.
SORRY.
SO YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE
ALL GOING TO GET A SHARED
SIGHTING CREDIT, RIGHT?
OH, CERTAINLY.
I'M SORRY I SHOULD HAVE
PREFACED ALL THIS BY SAYING
IT'S FINE. WE THINK WE SAW
SOMETHING FLYING SOUTH
A FEW HOURS AGO HEADING
TOWARDS CROSS LAKE
I THINK WE SHOULD
STICK WITH CEDAR.
IT'S THE MOST OBVIOUS CHOICE.
OF COURSE. WE CAN SPLIT UR,
AND WE'LL GO TO CEDAR
AND YOU GUYS CAN GO
TO THE RIVER.
A SEA DUCK RESTING ON A RIVER.
HAVE YOU EVEN BEEN
BIRDING BEFORE?
OH REALLY?
IT'S JUST WHAT I SAW.
PETER?
HEY!
PETER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
NO, NO, NO.
HEY! HEY!
GET OFF OF IT.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
GO, GO, GO.
HOLY SHIT.
THRILLING.
SO WHAT NOW?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN PETER
JUST STOLE YOUR FRIENDS' ATV
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO
STEAL OUR SIGHTING.
JUST THAT.
THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT.
ANOTHER WAY IS THAT WE ARE
FOUR BIRDERS LOOKING TO FIND
AN EXTINCT DUCK, STANDING
ON THE BRINK OF HISTORY.
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO STEAL THE
CREDIT FOR THE SIGHTING.
ARE WE COOL?
YES.
MIGUEL FORGOT A TIE.
DO YOU HAVE ONE?
HE'S NOT GOING TO
WANT ONE OF MY TIES.
LET ME SEE WHAT DAVID HAS.
DON, I'M GONNA NEED
THE LIST FOR THE
WHAT THE HELL IS ALL THIS?
I THINK I MIGHT BE
AN ASSHOLE, TED.
IT'S RARE I GO BIRDING
WITH A YOUNGER GENERATION.
I HAD HOPED THAT MY DAUGHTER
WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED IN MY
FOOTSTEPS, BUT SHE AND
MY EX-WIFE DETEST ME.
DID YOU AND YOUR
MOTHER BIRD TOGETHER?
YES.
A LOT.
SHE WOULD OF ADORED THIS.
YOU PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER,
BUT BACK IN THE 90S,
SHE DISCOVERED A NEW COLONY
OF PIPING PLOVERS
I HAVE ALL THE NEWSPAPER
CLIPPINGS.
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE
FEELING OF DISCOVERY.
HOW'S YOUR FATHER DOING?
IT MUST BE DIFFICULT
FOR THE TWO OF YOU NOW.
HE'S UM, HE'S GETTING MARRIED.
I SEE.
WELL EVERYONE COPES DIFFERENTLY.
AND SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST DICKS.
YOUR FATHER'S NOT A DICK.
I'M SORRY, YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.
WELL I DO ACTUALLY.
HE HELPED WITH ARCHIVING
DOTTIE'S RESEARCH MATERIALS AT
THE MAGAZINE AFTER SHE DIED.
WHAT?
WAIT, HOW?
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
BIRDS ARE MY MUSES.
AND I STRIVE TO
BE A TRUE WATCHER.
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN I
SPOTTED MY FIRST GREATER
PRAIRIE CHICKEN, BUT NOT MY OWN
DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY.
BUT YOU'RE ALREADY
I'M SIXTY-THREE YEARS
OLD AND VERY MUCH ALONE.
I GUIDE ASSHOLES FOR MONEY.
I HAVE ONE LEG AND
NO DRIVER'S LICENSE.
PLEASE DO NOT CONFUSE
ME WITH A ROLE MODEL.
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
A DRIVER'S LICENSE?
OH, BIT OF A MIX UP
BETWEEN WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AN
ALBINO NIGHT HAWK AND A HIGH
SPEED POLICE CHASE.
OK, KEEP LOOKING.
KEEP LOOKING. SEE IF YOU SEE IT.
REMARKABLE.
IT'S EMPTY THOUGH.
HERE GOES NOTHING.
WAS THAT IT?
MAYBE.
IT WAS A LITTLE MUFFLED.
IT WAS DEFINITELY
A GREETING CALL.
I THINK THAT MAYBE IT WAS
OH MY GOD!
THAT WOULD BE A MALE MALLARD.
OH.
WAIT, BUT WHY WOULD IT
ANSWER TO A SCOTER CALL?
MAYBE IT WAS RAISED BY SCOTERS.
IT WAS NOT RAISED
BY SCOTERS, OK?
YA KNOW? CROSS LAKE IS A FEW
MILES UP. I THINK MAYBE
WE SHOULD JUST GO THERE.
WHY WOULD WE GO TO THE LAKE
THAT'S FARTHER FROM SHORE?
IT'S NOT UNHEARD OF.
YEAH, IT'S PRACTICALLY
UNHEARD OF.
GUYS?
IS THAT YOUR DUCK, DAVID?
OH MY GOD.
WHAT'S IT DOING?
SHH.
IT'S PREENING.
THE LIGHT COULDN'T BE BETTER.
IT'S A MAGNIFICENT BIRD.
âªâª
SHIT!
HEY FELLAS.
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?
I'M CARL SR. THIS IS
MY SON, CARL JR.
OH AWESOME. YOU JUST
SHOT AN EXTINCT DUCK.
TIMMY, CALM DOWN.
I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT WORD MEANS.
YOU'RE FRIEND IS NUTS.
WOAH, WOAH, WOAH.
EASY.
HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN?
THESE MORONS SHOT IT.
EVERYONE, RELAX.
YOU SHOT AN EXTINCT DUCK, SIR.
DOES EXTINCT MEAN SOMETHING
DIFFERENT THESE DAYS?
IT'S SUFFERING.
GIVE IT TO ME.
PLEASE.
PLEASE.
MAY I SEE THE ANIMAL?
THIS ISN'T A LABRADOR DUCK.
WHAT?
ITS NECK DOES DECLINE STRANGELY,
BUT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE
IS AN ODDLY PLUMAGED,
HYBRID MALLARD.
LOOK AT THE WING MARKINGS.
SEE, THE WING MARKINGS
ALWAYS CONCERN ME.
YEP, IT'S DEFINITELY
AN ODD HYBRID OF SORTS.
JUST SHUT UP, JEFF.
IF IT'S OK WITH YOU GUYS,
WE'D LIKE TO TAKE THE DUCK
FOR OUR BANQUET.
BANQUET?
WE'RE HUNTING FOR
OUR CHURCH BANQUET.
ALL THE PROCEEDS ARE GOING TO
THE SAVE DARFUR FOUNDATION.
WELL, THAT'S A BIT
OF A SILVER LINING.
DAVID, IT'S
DAVID, IT WAS JUST
A HYBRID MALLARD.
HE LOOKED AT ME.
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO SUFFER.
I KNOW.
WHY'D SHE HAVE TO DIE?
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
YOU KNOW, IN INDIANA JONES AND
THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, THE BAD GUY
THAT GOES AROUND, AND HE RIPS
THE HEART OUT OF PEOPLE, AND HE
HOLDS IT UP IN FRONT OF THEIR
FACE SO THEY WATCH IT BEAT.
YEAH, I HATE THAT PART.
I... I DON'T SEE HOW
IT'LL EVER STOP HURTING.
WELL, UM, MAYBE ONE DAY IT'LL
FEEL LESS AWFUL THAN RIPPING AN
ORGAN OUT OF YOUR CHEST PAIN?
BUT MY GUESS IS IT
WILL ALWAYS HURT.
YEAH.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
WHAT-WHAT TIME IS IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK MY PHONE DIED
LIKE THREE HOURS AGO
WILL WE MAKE IT BACK
FOR THE WEDDING?
I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE A CAR.
WE COULD ASK
I WONDER IF I HAVE
CELL SERVICE
OH MY GOD.
WHAT?
WHAT?
THIS IS WORSE THAN IT LOOKS.
WE NEED TO GET YOU HOME.
YEAH.
SO, THOSE GUYS WEREN'T
REALLY DRUG LORDS.
NO, THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH
THE OPPOSITE OF DRUG LORDS.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
TASTE THAT, ARE YOU?
SSS.
JUST KIDDING, IT'S ROCK CANDY.
I SAID IT WAS ROCK CANDY.
YOU'RE FIRST CORRECT ID.
IT'S GOING ON MY LIFE LIST.
NOW WE'LL HEAR A MUSICAL
SELECTION FROM THE
SON OF THE BRIDE,
MIGUEL SANTOS.
MIGUEL.
âª MEET ME TONIGHT IN DREAMLAND âª
âª UNDER THE SILVERY MOON âª
âª MEET ME TONIGHT IN DREAMLAND âª
âª WHERE LOVE'S SWEET
ROSES BLOOM âª
âª MEET ME IN DREAMLAND âª
âª OH SWEET DREAMY DREAMLAND âª
âª THERE MAKE MY
DREAMS COME TRUE âª
THANK YOU, MIGUEL.
AND NOW THE RINGS, DAVID.
YOU WORKING AT YOUR OWN WEDDING?
RIGHT? IT'S PRETTY MESSED UP.
YOU KNOW THERE'S A MILLION
PEOPLE TO TALK TO OUT THERE?
I KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR HIRING ERIC I GUESS.
THAT IS WHAT YOU GET.
DAD.
YEAH?
WERE YOU SEEING JULIANA
BEFORE OR AFTER MOM?
DEFINITELY AFTER.
OK.
YOUR MOTHER WAS THE
LOVE OF MY LIFE.
YOU KNOW THAT.
NO, I DIDN'T.
AH JESUS CHRIST.
DAVID, I'M SORRY I SHOULD
HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB OF
EXPLAINING IT ALL.
WE SPOKE ABOUT IT.
NO WE DIDN'T.
WE DIDN'T SPEAK ABOUT
IT. NOT REALLY.
WE DIDN'T.
YOU KNOW, IT'S
IT'S LIKE YOU REMEMBER THAT
I JUST DON'T' WANT TO PRETEND
THAT WE DON'T MISS MOM.
ME EITHER.
WANNA GRAB THAT CHICKEN?
BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT
WE WERE TERRORISTS.
IT WAS AWFUL.
HEY.
EXCUSE ME.
ARE YOU IN A BAND OR SOMETHING?
EXCUSE ME?
HELLO?
HEY.
HEY, EVERYONE.
UM
SO TECHNICALLY I'M
THE BEST MAN HERE,
AND I GUESS I'M SUPPOSED
TO GIVE A TOAST.
UM
WHERE DO I START?
THE THING IS
THE LAST COUPLE OF
DAYS I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR AN EXTINCT DUCK.
NO, IT'S NOT LIKE A
METAPHOR OR SOMETHING.
IT TURNS OUT IT WASN'T EXTINCT.
ACTUALLY IT WASN'T THE
DUCK I THOUGHT IT WAS.
AND IT GOT SHOT.
BUT IN A WEIRD WAY IT TURNS
OUT IT MIGHT HELP THE WHOLE
SITUATION GOING ON IN DARFUR.
SORRY, ANYWAY
I'M GLAD I MADE IT HERE.
TODAY.
ALTHOUGH THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE
BEEN KINDA ROUGH FOR OUR FAMILY.
UM
DAVID?
I KNOW, SORRY.
DAD LIKES TO FILL
HOLES WITH LISTS.
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.
HE WRITES LISTS OF EVERYTHING.
LIKE LISTS OF LISTS.
AND I LIKE TO FIND RARE BIRDS,
SO I'M NOT REALLY ONE TALK.
BUT IT DOESN'T
DOESN'T REALLY WORK,
WHICH IS WHY I AM SO GLAD
HE FOUND JULIANA.
BECAUSE I KNOW MY MOM
REALLY LIKED HER AND MY DAD
OBVIOUSLY LIKES HER TOO.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE
ALL HERE RIGHT.
SO
I WISH THEM A HAPPY
AND LONG LIFE TOGETHER.
HERE'S TO DAD AND JULIANA.
YOU WERE PERFECT.
SO, DOES ERIC KNOW THAT WE,
LIKE, DESTROYED HIS ENGINE?
AH YOU KNOW
THE TIMING'S NOT QUITE RIGHT.
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ERIC, ALRIGHT?
I'VE GOT SOME SERIOUS
SHIT ON HIM THAT
I'VE BEEN SAVING FOR
A MOMENT LIKE THIS.
GOT IT.
I THINK I'M GONNA HEAD HOME NOW.
YEAH, ME TOO.
GOOD TIMES.
TOTALLY.
BYE.
SO HOW LONG SHOULD I
WAIT UNTIL I CALL KIM?
WHAT?
YOU GOT HER NUMBER?
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THAT, DUDE?
I SHOULD GO TOO.
I GUESS.
SO, WEIRDLY ENOUGH I HAD
A LOT OF FUN THIS WEEKEND.
SO DID I.
PETER GAVE ME HIS OLD PAIR.
I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT AS
GOOD AS YOURS, BUT
I'M KINDA GETTING THE HANG
HI.
SO UM
I GUESS I'll SEE YOU TOMORROW.
YEAH, OK.
DEFINITELY.
BYE.
SEE YA.
BYE."
